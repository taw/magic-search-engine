The 18-year-old Maryland native was the 1998 U.S. National Champion. Linde played a very fast mono-green \"Stompy\" deck with 26 creatures—24 of which cost two mana or less to play. Supplementing this furious creature assault were four Rancors and four Giant Growths. Though the deck was designed to win by turn five, it did feature four Cursed Scrolls in case the game dragged on.","type":"Card","types":["Card"],"uuid":"6ae5003a-5dc9-524c-a847-7c49febf290e"},{"availability":["paper"],"borderColor":"gold","colorIdentity":[],"colors":[],"finishes":["nonfoil"],"frameVersion":"1997","hasFoil":false,"hasNonFoil":true,"identifiers":{"mtgjsonV4Id":"dffa2079-ebd7-531a-8a7a-75415279dd44","scryfallCardBackId":"407ed11d-7b6f-4e1c-ab00-f49c25f170e3","scryfallId":"72dd6b5f-f95b-48f8-a126-0ade77f0f638","scryfallOracleId":"c3b349dd-9e9c-4af7-ae1f-c9e924dcfa1a","tcgplayerProductId":"164988"},"language":"English","layout":"token","name":"Matt Linde Decklist","number":"ml0b","reverseRelated":[],"setCode":"WC99","subtypes":[],"supertypes":[],"type":"Card","types":["Card"],"uuid":"6f146f2f-3b10-529a-985d-1d813be0e4fc"},{"availability":["paper"],"borderColor":"gold","colorIdentity":[],"colors":[],"finishes":["nonfoil","signed"],"frameVersion":"1997","hasFoil":false,"hasNonFoil":true,"identifiers":{"mtgjsonV4Id":"2f27a781-02ac-5a1d-880d-f09a43542db5","scryfallCardBackId":"407ed11d-7b6f-4e1c-ab00-f49c25f170e3","scryfallId":"3a959416-27be-4c92-ac4b-0404529ca978","scryfallOracleId":"6f0d897b-88ea-4119-909a-8a9564d04c15","tcgplayerProductId":"164963"},"language":"English","layout":"token","name":"Mark Le Pine Bio","number":"mlp0a","reverseRelated":[],"setCode":"WC99","signature":"Mark Le Pine","subtypes":[],"supertypes":[],"text":"Though only 17 years old, New Hampshire—native Mark Le Pine is a Pro Tour veteran.
