Then take any number of creatures on the battlefield and place them side-by-side on the table in front of Devil K. Nevil. Those creature cards should be horizontal to Devil K.

Nevil as it can be without touching it, but if you’d like to make the jump more difficult, we’re not going to stop you. To execute the jump, flick Devil K. Nevil from underneath to cause it to fly up into the air and forward, majestically flying over the line of creatures. You can’t just flick him horizontally. Devil craves hang time. If Devil comes to rest completely past the creatures without touching any of them, it has cleared those creatures and will earn those +1/+1 counters. If it touches any of the creatures during the jump, that’s okay, as long as Devil comes to rest past the creatures, not touching any of them. All of Devil K. Nevil must be past the farthest creature for the jump to be successful. If Devil veers off to the side and doesn’t get farther than the last creature, the jump is unsuccessful, even if it comes to rest not touching any of the creatures. An unsuccessful jump has no consequences other than shame. Shame and no +1/+1 counters."},{"date":"2022-10-07","text":"The jump is considered attempted if your hand makes contact with Devil K.

Nevil from underneath to cause it to fly up into the air and forward, majestically flying over the line of creatures. You can’t just flick him horizontally. Devil craves hang time.
