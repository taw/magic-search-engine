Tomcani's version, which splashed black, follows the normal Fires archetype of playing cheap creatures followed by Fires of Yavimaya and big creatures like Blastoderm or Spiritmonger.","type":"Card","types":["Card"],"uuid":"bc4003e7-b748-55e2-8c79-dee29ff44679"},{"availability":["paper"],"borderColor":"gold","colorIdentity":[],"colors":[],"finishes":["nonfoil"],"frameVersion":"1997","hasFoil":false,"hasNonFoil":true,"identifiers":{"mtgjsonV4Id":"dfa88cd9-7204-55ec-802e-7d99b3957f04","scryfallCardBackId":"0aeebaf5-8c7d-4636-9e82-8c27447861f7","scryfallId":"e2ffc06e-fed9-4241-9fa5-0d11858765a6","scryfallOracleId":"f79c37a3-df31-4974-ba7f-6348a78fdde3","tcgplayerProductId":"165084"},"language":"English","layout":"token","name":"Jan Tomcani Decklist","number":"jt0b","reverseRelated":[],"setCode":"WC01","subtypes":[],"supertypes":[],"type":"Card","types":["Card"],"uuid":"f063a8ef-bb2e-5f9e-b03d-43353ad21578"},{"availability":["paper"],"borderColor":"gold","colorIdentity":[],"colors":[],"finishes":["nonfoil","signed"],"frameVersion":"1997","hasFoil":false,"hasNonFoil":true,"identifiers":{"mtgjsonV4Id":"a9bfc59b-d758-53d4-b529-a980b389fb0a","scryfallCardBackId":"420c2336-e212-4109-8525-b0fc69201351","scryfallId":"67f1746f-4f15-48da-9de7-3dd62811afdb","scryfallOracleId":"169918f0-a29d-429a-b236-ecc4d5cf028f","tcgplayerProductId":"164307"},"language":"English","layout":"token","name":"Tom van de Logt Bio (2001)","number":"tvdl0a","reverseRelated":[],"setCode":"WC01","signature":"Tom van de Logt","subtypes":[],"supertypes":[],"text":"Tom van de Logt is the 2001 Netherlands National Champion as well as one of an elite group of players who have posted back-to-back World Championship Top 8 performances.
