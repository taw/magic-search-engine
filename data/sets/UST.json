A creature with triple strike deals first-strike combat damage, regular combat damage, and last-strike combat damage. Note that it has to survive each time to deal more damage later. For example, if a 3/3 creature with triple strike is blocked by a 3/3 creature with first strike, the two creatures will take each other out during first-strike combat damage. But if left unblocked, that creature will deal a total of 9 damage to the defending player or planeswalker."}],"scryfallId":"e35c6dd7-84eb-42ff-a950-705bc0d1811e","scryfallIllustrationId":"f5114654-f227-4698-9ec9-e6512b23c00a","scryfallOracleId":"0c7d18bc-7527-472e-bf0f-6b06ff1c541a","subtypes":["Goblin","Mutant"],"supertypes":[],"tcgplayerProductId":152660,"text":"Triple strike (This creature deals first-strike, regular, and last-strike combat damage.)","toughness":"3","type":"Creature — Goblin Mutant","types":["Creature"],"uuid":"496183a7-153d-54e9-a0a4-c5b1a82bf9ea","watermark":"goblinexplosioneers"},{"artist":"Steve Prescott","borderColor":"borderless","colorIdentity":[],"colors":[],"convertedManaCost":0.0,"foreignData":[],"frameVersion":"2015","hasFoil":true,"hasNonFoil":true,"isPaper":true,"layout":"normal","legalities":{},"mcmId":314042,"mcmMetaId":235442,"multiverseId":439595,"name":"Thud-for-Duds","number":"206","originalText":"Whenever you crank Thud-for-Duds, roll two six-sided dice.
