The white-blue-green \"Wake\" deck is named after the powerful enchantment that's the heart of the deck. Once Mirari's Wake is in play, the deck produces more mana, draws more cards, counters more spells, and makes more Soldiers than opponents can possibly handle. Zink had help from fellow German and 2002-2003 Player of the Year Kai Budde in adapting the \"Wake\" deck to the post—Eigth Edition environment.","type":"Card","types":["Card"],"uuid":"0fe408be-4c73-5e47-8ba8-ad3d8c19eadb"},{"availability":["paper"],"borderColor":"gold","colorIdentity":[],"colors":[],"finishes":["nonfoil"],"frameVersion":"2003","hasFoil":false,"hasNonFoil":true,"identifiers":{"mtgjsonV4Id":"bcdd0b3f-ff4f-548d-abc1-341cce3ac47b","scryfallCardBackId":"0645a083-9e19-43db-9e76-4a424d53895d","scryfallId":"93380a7d-8df1-4cce-bf88-67e3b73eb70c","scryfallOracleId":"8a23e534-465c-426f-97e5-dc2d8bee75d0","tcgplayerProductId":"173915"},"language":"English","layout":"token","name":"Daniel Zink Decklist","number":"dz0b","reverseRelated":[],"setCode":"WC03","subtypes":[],"supertypes":[],"type":"Card","types":["Card"],"uuid":"9f17645a-7eb9-55d2-bef6-b1b5bb9f5649"},{"asciiName":"Peer Kroger Bio","availability":["paper"],"borderColor":"gold","colorIdentity":[],"colors":[],"finishes":["nonfoil","signed"],"frameVersion":"2003","hasFoil":false,"hasNonFoil":true,"identifiers":{"mtgjsonV4Id":"925981b4-ffba-5c36-87d4-5c727604d459","scryfallCardBackId":"0645a083-9e19-43db-9e76-4a424d53895d","scryfallId":"6a45947b-7832-4a0b-836b-63693bf550f8","scryfallOracleId":"d3654ade-36d7-43f4-88c2-b4e0725acdaa","tcgplayerProductId":"174153"},"language":"English","layout":"token","name":"Peer Kröger Bio","number":"pk0a","reverseRelated":[],"setCode":"WC03","signature":"Peer Kröger","subtypes":[],"supertypes":[],"text":"Hometown hero Peer Kröger played his own version of the classic \"Reanimator\" deck to an impressive record during this year's World Championships.

He achieved this by adding black to the deck for Patriarch's Bidding, which brings every Goblin in the graveyard back to play. And with cards like Goblin Warchief and Siege-Gang Commander, those Goblins have haste and bring friends with them!
