# To fully balance it like DOM, probabilities of double walker pack are negative!
# If we disallow double planeswalker packs (rare pw and uncommon pw in same pack),
# probabilities turn into almost perfect but not quite so values 1/1936 and 1/5808 deviation
#
# We can make this deviation go on rares on uncommons, either way it's too tiny to notice
# Japanese planeswalkers appear at same rate as regular planeswalkers
