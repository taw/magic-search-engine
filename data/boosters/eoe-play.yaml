########## Calculations for the wildcard slot:
# In this slot Wizards give 4 cateogries of cards with chances "less than 1%":
# - mythic from the main set
# - mythic viewport land
# - rare or mythic triumphant
# - rare or mythic surreal

# Until more information is available, we'll have to make assumptions.
# The sum of all chances that are detailed is 12.5% + 62.5% + 10.6% + 10% + 2.5% + 1% = 99.1%
# So we have 0.9% to distribute among the 4 categories.

# We'll give each category the same chance: 0.9% / 4 = 0.225%


########## Calculations for the rare slot:
# The sum of all chances that are detailed is 80.4% + 14.2% + 2% + 2% = 98.6%
# So we have 1.4% to distribute.

# We assume that both triumphant and surreal cards have a 2:1 rate for rare:mythic.
# That gives us:
#   - triumphant (12 rares, 4 mythics)
#     - rare = 2%
#     - mythic = 0.33%
#   - surreal (11 rares, 3 mythics)
#     - rare = 2%
#     - mythic = 0.27%

# Finally, the mythic viewport is 1.4% - 0.33% - 0.27% = 0.8%


########## Calculations for the foil slot:
# The sum of all chances that are detailed is 58% + 32% + 6.4% + 1.1% +1% = 98.5%
# So we have 1.5% to distribute.

# First we assume that Stellar Sights lands have a 2:1 rate for rare:mythic.
# Stellar Sight lands are 30 rares, 15 mythics. That gives us 1% chance for a rare and 0.25% for a mythic.
# Then we have 1.5% - 0.25% = 1.25% to distribute between viewport, tirumphant and surreal. We'll give 0.42% each.
