# there's guaranteed legendary creature, but no separate slots for that
# If we don't model anything, there's 71% chance of opening a legendary creature, and EV of 1.45
#
# Here's a simple model:
# * all cards of same rarity equally frequent
# * you'll get legend in every pack
# * if rares/mythics is not legend, you get exactly 1 legend uncommon
# * if rares/mythics is legend, you might get 0 or 1 legend uncommon
# * foil work as in every other set
#
# I suspect there's a chance to get 2 or 3 legend uncommons in a pack
# (9/64 and 1/64 if DOM was a regular set), so we could add more cases
# and adjus numbers accordingly
