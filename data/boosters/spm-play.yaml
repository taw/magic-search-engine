########## rare_mythic sheet:
# It seems safe to assume rares and mythics are printed in a single sheet with a 2:1 ratio.
# This ratio applies to all slots that contain rares and mythics (wildard, rare_mythic_boosterfun, foil).

########## uncommon_scene sheet:
# We are assumming that the 3 uncommon scene cards appear as often as the 55 uncommons from the main set.

########## boosterfun sheet:
# We are assumming that all boosterfun cards (web-slinger, panel and scene) that have the same rarity
# appear in a similar 2:1 rare:mythic ratio.
# This doesn't exactly match the numbers provided by Wizards in the "Rare or mythic rare" slot
# but it simplifies the work a lot. Numbers are so low for these cards that it's unlkely to be relevant.
