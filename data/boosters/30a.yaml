# Each pack of 30th Anniversary Edition contains 15 cards, 13 cards in the modern frame—1 rare, 3 uncommons,
# 7 commons, and 2 basic lands—plus one basic land in the retro frame, one additional retro frame card, and a token.

    # We know two things:
    # - "approximately three out of every ten packs will contain a rare retro frame card"
    # - "Each dual land has 2x the normal frequency. This is true for both modern frame and retro frame dual lands."
    # This is not how normal cards (6% rare) or foils (15% rare) work
    #
    # But that's not quite saying they're all equally likely (except duals double), as then we'd have 40% rare.
    # Flat-ish but not totally flat distribution where C/Dual is 2x, U is 1.5x, R is 1x fits the distribution
    # with rare ratio on 29.7% and very clean numbers.
    # Yes this means retro dual is as frequent as retro common, which sounds weird
