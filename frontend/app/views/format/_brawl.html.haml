  Decks consist of 60 cards and no sideboard, one of which is a legendary creature or planeswalker chosen as a commander.

  Except for basic lands, all cards are allowed in only 1 copy. No card is allowed if its color identity contains colors outside color identity of the chosen commander. As an exception if your commander is colorless, you are allowed to play any number of basic land of any one chosen type.
