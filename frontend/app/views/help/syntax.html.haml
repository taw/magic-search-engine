    %div
      Here are some examples.
      Everything is case insensitive.
      All Unicode characters like "Æ" can be spelled with their plain equivalents like "Ae" as well.

    %div
      Most syntax from other search engines works here.
      If you have any suggestions for new useful syntax, feel free to contact me.

    %div
      In addition to these, there are special color queries. <code>c:</code> and <code>ci:</code> with a colon follow traditional system from MCI - they're still supported, but not recommended. I recommend using <code>=</code>, <code>&gt;=</code> instead, as they're much more consistent.
    %ul

    %h4 Search by color identity
    %div
      You can search by color identity same way you can search by color.
      If you want to find cards legal in your Commander deck, you usually want <code>ci<=temur</code> style query.
      If you want a Commander of specific identity, you usually want <code>ci=temur</code> style query.

    %ul
      = search_help "ci=w", "cards whose identity is exactly white"

      = search_help "cmc<2", "cards with converted mana cost less than 2"

    %h4 Search by mana cost
    %div For sake of this search every mana symbol is treated as non-comparable, so "{u}" is neither greater or less than "{u/b}" etc. There's a lot of flexibility, so "{up}", "{u/p}", "{P/U}" etc. all work for Phyrexian blue mana. Curly braces are only needed for non-standard mana types.

    %h4 Search by card's collector number
    %div You can search by specific card number, by number range. For some old and promo cards without printed numbers, they have been arbitrarily assiged.
    %div You can also use special number "set" to indicate set's official card count. Most new sets have cards within official number that go into regular boosters like "1/280" to "280/280", and special cards ("281/280" etc.) for buy a box promos, showcase cards, cards for precon decks, Collector boosters exclusives etc.

    %div firstprint: operator can be somewhat confusing, as a lot of cards which you'd technically consider to come out in a set technically came out in a Prerelease (dated one week before) or a Duel Deck (a few weeks before) that set. Online-only sets are included too.
