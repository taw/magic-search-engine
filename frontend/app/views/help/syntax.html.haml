    %div firstprint: operator can be somewhat confusing, as a lot of cards which you'd technically consider to come out in a set technically came out in a Prerelease (dated one week before) or a Duel Deck (a few weeks before) that set. Online-only sets are included too.

    %h4 Search by other part
    %div Every card part (of split, flip, or double-faced card) is treated as separate object, so search like cmc=2 cmc=3 won't return anything, as no part has cmc of 2 and 3 simultaneously. There's special syntax for that.

      = search_help "cmc=2 part:w", "cards parts with converted mana cost 2, for which either side is white"

    %h4 Search by alternative printing
    %div Every card printing is treated as separate object, so you can't search for cards which were printing in both Magic 2010 and Magic 2011 with e:m10 e:m11. There's special syntax for that.
    %ul
      = search_help "e:m10 alt:e:m11", "cards from Magic 2010 which were also printed in Magic 2011"
      = search_help %Q[a:"Rebecca Guay" alt:(not a:"Rebecca Guay")], "cards drawn by Rebecca Guay which were also printed by someone who's not Rebecca Guay"

    %h4 Time travel
    %div You can travel to any time by specifying set code, set name, or full date (partial date like "1999" will be interpretted as "1 January 1999"). Cards printed since then won't be returned, and status of various formats will be as it was at that time. So if you want to argue about what was best Modern Pod deck back in that time just roll back the time to before the ban and enjoy.

    %div Formats should generally be fully accurate from 2004 onwards (Legacy/Vintage split), information about older times might contain inaccuracies.

    %div You can specify multiple time periods with use of parentheses.
