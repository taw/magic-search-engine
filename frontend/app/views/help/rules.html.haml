%h4 Magic: The Gathering Comprehensive Rules
%p These rules are effective as of April 14, 2023.
%h3{id: "section-introduction"} Introduction
%p This document is the ultimate authority for Magic: The Gathering® competitive game play. It consists of a series of numbered rules followed by a glossary. Many of the numbered rules are divided into subrules, and each separate rule and subrule of the game has its own number. (Note that subrules skip the letters “l” and “o” due to potential confusion with the numbers “1” and “0”; subrule 704.5k is followed by 704.5m, then 704.5n, then 704.5p, for example.)
%p Changes may have been made to this document since its publication. You can download the most recent version from the Magic rules website at Magic.Wizards.com/Rules. If you have questions, you can get the answers from us at Support.Wizards.com.

  .rule_text Game Concepts
.rule{id: "section-100"}
  .rule_id 100.
  .rule_text General
.rule{id: "section-100-1"}
  .rule_id 100.1.
  .rule_text These Magic rules apply to any Magic game with two or more players, including two-player games and multiplayer games.
.rule{id: "section-100-1a"}
  .rule_id 100.1a
  .rule_text A two-player game is a game that begins with only two players.
.rule{id: "section-100-1b"}
  .rule_id 100.1b
  .rule_text A multiplayer game is a game that begins with more than two players. See section 8, “Multiplayer Rules.”
.rule{id: "section-100-2"}
  .rule_id 100.2.
  .rule_text To play, each player needs their own deck of traditional Magic cards, small items to represent any tokens and counters, and some way to clearly track life totals.
.rule{id: "section-100-2a"}
  .rule_id 100.2a
  .rule_text In constructed play (a way of playing in which each player creates their own deck ahead of time), each deck has a minimum deck size of 60 cards. A constructed deck may contain any number of basic land cards and no more than four of any card with a particular English name other than basic land cards. For the purposes of deck construction, cards with interchangeable names have the same English name (see rule <a href="#section-201-3">201.3</a>).
.rule{id: "section-100-2b"}
  .rule_id 100.2b
  .rule_text In limited play (a way of playing in which each player gets the same quantity of unopened Magic product such as booster packs and creates their own deck using only this product and basic land cards), each deck has a minimum deck size of 40 cards. A limited deck may contain as many duplicates of a card as are included with the product.
.rule{id: "section-100-2c"}
  .rule_id 100.2c
  .rule_text Commander decks are subject to additional deckbuilding restrictions and requirements. See rule <a href="#section-903">903</a>, “Commander,” for details.
.rule{id: "section-100-2d"}
  .rule_id 100.2d
  .rule_text Some formats and casual play variants allow players to use a supplementary deck of nontraditional Magic cards (see rule <a href="#section-108-2a">108.2a</a>). These supplementary decks have their own deck construction rules. See rule <a href="#section-717">717</a>, “Attraction Cards;” rule <a href="#section-901">901</a>, “Planechase;” and rule <a href="#section-904">904</a>, “Archenemy.”
.rule{id: "section-100-3"}
  .rule_id 100.3.
  .rule_text Some cards require coins or traditional dice. Some casual variants require additional items, such as specially designated cards, nontraditional Magic cards, and specialized dice.
.rule{id: "section-100-4"}
  .rule_id 100.4.
  .rule_text Each player may also have a sideboard, which is a group of additional cards the player may use to modify their deck between games of a match.
.rule{id: "section-100-4a"}
  .rule_id 100.4a
  .rule_text In constructed play, a sideboard may contain no more than fifteen cards. The four-card limit (see rule <a href="#section-100-2a">100.2a</a>) applies to the combined deck and sideboard.
.rule{id: "section-100-4b"}
  .rule_id 100.4b
  .rule_text In limited play involving individual players, all cards in a player’s card pool not included in their deck are in that player’s sideboard.
.rule{id: "section-100-4c"}
  .rule_id 100.4c
  .rule_text In limited play involving the Two-Headed Giant multiplayer variant, all cards in a team’s card pool but not in either player’s deck are in that team’s sideboard.
.rule{id: "section-100-4d"}
  .rule_id 100.4d
  .rule_text In limited play involving other multiplayer team variants, each card in a team’s card pool but not in any player’s deck is assigned to the sideboard of one of those players. Each player has their own sideboard; cards may not be transferred between players.
.rule{id: "section-100-5"}
  .rule_id 100.5.
  .rule_text If a deck must contain at least a certain number of cards, that number is referred to as a minimum deck size. There is no maximum deck size for non-Commander decks.
.rule{id: "section-100-6"}
  .rule_id 100.6.
  .rule_text Most Magic tournaments (organized play activities where players compete against other players to win prizes) have additional rules covered in the Magic: The Gathering Tournament Rules (found at WPN.Wizards.com/en/resources/rules-documents). These rules may limit the use of some cards, including barring all cards from some older sets.
.rule{id: "section-100-6a"}
  .rule_id 100.6a
  .rule_text Tournaments usually consist of a series of matches. A two-player match usually involves playing until one player has won two games. A multiplayer match usually consists of only one game.
.rule{id: "section-100-6b"}
  .rule_id 100.6b
  .rule_text Players can use the Magic Store &amp; Event Locator at Wizards.com/Locator to find tournaments in their area.
.rule{id: "section-100-7"}
  .rule_id 100.7.
  .rule_text Certain cards are intended for casual play and may have features and text that aren’t covered by these rules. These include Mystery Booster playtest cards, promotional cards and cards in “Un-sets” that were printed with a silver border, and cards in the Unfinity™ expansion that have an acorn symbol at the bottom of the card.
.rule{id: "section-101"}
  .rule_id 101.
  .rule_text The Magic Golden Rules
.rule{id: "section-101-1"}
  .rule_id 101.1.
  .rule_text Whenever a card’s text directly contradicts these rules, the card takes precedence. The card overrides only the rule that applies to that specific situation. The only exception is that a player can concede the game at any time (see rule <a href="#section-104-3a">104.3a</a>).
.rule{id: "section-101-2"}
  .rule_id 101.2.
  .rule_text When a rule or effect allows or directs something to happen, and another effect states that it can’t happen, the “can’t” effect takes precedence.
  .rule_text Example: If one effect reads “You may play an additional land this turn” and another reads “You can’t play lands this turn,” the effect that precludes you from playing lands wins.
.rule{id: "section-101-2a"}
  .rule_id 101.2a
  .rule_text Adding abilities to objects and removing abilities from objects don’t fall under this rule. (See rule <a href="#section-113-10">113.10</a>.)
.rule{id: "section-101-3"}
  .rule_id 101.3.
  .rule_text Any part of an instruction that’s impossible to perform is ignored. (In many cases the card will specify consequences for this; if it doesn’t, there’s no effect.)
.rule{id: "section-101-4"}
  .rule_id 101.4.
  .rule_text If multiple players would make choices and/or take actions at the same time, the active player (the player whose turn it is) makes any choices required, then the next player in turn order (usually the player seated to the active player’s left) makes any choices required, followed by the remaining nonactive players in turn order. Then the actions happen simultaneously. This rule is often referred to as the “Active Player, Nonactive Player (APNAP) order” rule.
  .rule_text Example: A card reads “Each player sacrifices a creature.” First, the active player chooses a creature they control. Then each of the nonactive players, in turn order, chooses a creature they control. Then all creatures chosen this way are sacrificed simultaneously.
.rule{id: "section-101-4a"}
  .rule_id 101.4a
  .rule_text If an effect has each player choose a card in a hidden zone, such as their hand or library, those cards may remain face down as they’re chosen. However, each player must clearly indicate which face-down card they are choosing.
.rule{id: "section-101-4b"}
  .rule_id 101.4b
  .rule_text A player knows the choices made by the previous players when making their choice, except as specified in <a href="#section-101-4a">101.4a</a>.
.rule{id: "section-101-4c"}
  .rule_id 101.4c
  .rule_text If a player would make more than one choice at the same time, the player makes the choices in the order specified. If no order is specified, the player chooses the order.
.rule{id: "section-101-4d"}
  .rule_id 101.4d
  .rule_text If a choice made by a nonactive player causes the active player, or a different nonactive player earlier in the turn order, to have to make a choice, APNAP order is restarted for all outstanding choices.
.rule{id: "section-101-4e"}
  .rule_id 101.4e
  .rule_text If multiple players would make choices or take actions while starting the game, the starting player is considered the active player and each other player is considered a nonactive player.
.rule{id: "section-102"}
  .rule_id 102.
  .rule_text Players
.rule{id: "section-102-1"}
  .rule_id 102.1.
  .rule_text A player is one of the people in the game. The active player is the player whose turn it is. The other players are nonactive players.
.rule{id: "section-102-2"}
  .rule_id 102.2.
  .rule_text In a two-player game, a player’s opponent is the other player.
.rule{id: "section-102-3"}
  .rule_id 102.3.
  .rule_text In a multiplayer game between teams, a player’s teammates are the other players on their team, and the player’s opponents are all players not on their team.
.rule{id: "section-102-4"}
  .rule_id 102.4.
  .rule_text A spell or ability may use the term “your team” as shorthand for “you and/or your teammates.” In a game that isn’t a multiplayer game between teams, “your team” means the same thing as “you.”
.rule{id: "section-103"}
  .rule_id 103.
  .rule_text Starting the Game
.rule{id: "section-103-1"}
  .rule_id 103.1.
  .rule_text At the start of a game, the players determine which one of them will choose who takes the first turn. In the first game of a match (including a single-game match), the players may use any mutually agreeable method (flipping a coin, rolling dice, etc.) to do so. In a match of several games, the loser of the previous game chooses who takes the first turn. If the previous game was a draw, the player who made the choice in that game makes the choice in this game. The player chosen to take the first turn is the starting player. The game’s default turn order begins with the starting player and proceeds clockwise.
.rule{id: "section-103-1a"}
  .rule_id 103.1a
  .rule_text In a game using the shared team turns option, there is a starting team rather than a starting player.
.rule{id: "section-103-1b"}
  .rule_id 103.1b
  .rule_text In an Archenemy game, these methods aren’t used to determine who takes the first turn. Rather, the archenemy takes the first turn.

  .rule_text Each player draws a number of cards equal to their starting hand size, which is normally seven. (Some effects can modify a player’s starting hand size.) A player who is dissatisfied with their initial hand may take a mulligan. First, the starting player declares whether they will take a mulligan. Then each other player in turn order does the same. Once each player has made a declaration, all players who decided to take mulligans do so at the same time. To take a mulligan, a player shuffles the cards in their hand back into their library, draws a new hand of cards equal to their starting hand size, then puts a number of those cards equal to the number of times that player has taken a mulligan on the bottom of their library in any order. Once a player chooses not to take a mulligan, the remaining cards become that player’s opening hand, and that player may not take any further mulligans. This process is then repeated until no player takes a mulligan. A player can take mulligans until their opening hand would be zero cards, after which they may not take further mulligans.

.rule{id: "section-106-3"}
  .rule_id 106.3.
  .rule_text Mana is produced by the effects of mana abilities (see rule <a href="#section-605">605</a>). It may also be produced by the effects of spells, as well as by the effects of abilities that aren’t mana abilities. A spell or ability that produces mana instructs a player to add that mana. If mana is produced by a spell, the source of that mana is that spell. If mana is produced by an ability, the source of that mana is the source of that ability (see rule <a href="#section-113-7">113.7</a>).
.rule{id: "section-106-4"}
  .rule_id 106.4.
  .rule_text When an effect instructs a player to add mana, that mana goes into a player’s mana pool. From there, it can be used to pay costs immediately, or it can stay in the player’s mana pool as unspent mana. Each player’s mana pool empties at the end of each step and phase, and the player is said to lose this mana. Cards with abilities that produce mana or refer to unspent mana have received errata in the Oracle™ card reference to no longer explicitly refer to the mana pool.
.rule{id: "section-106-4a"}
  .rule_id 106.4a

  .rule_text If a player passes priority (see rule <a href="#section-117">117</a>) while there is mana in their mana pool, that player announces what mana is there.
.rule{id: "section-106-5"}
  .rule_id 106.5.
  .rule_text If an ability would produce one or more mana of an undefined type, it produces no mana instead.
  .rule_text Example: Meteor Crater has the ability “<span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-t"><span class="sr-only">{T}</span></span></span>: Choose a color of a permanent you control. Add one mana of that color.” If you control no colored permanents, activating Meteor Crater’s mana ability produces no mana.
.rule{id: "section-106-6"}
  .rule_id 106.6.
  .rule_text Some spells or abilities that produce mana restrict how that mana can be spent, have an additional effect that affects the spell or ability that mana is spent on, or create a delayed triggered ability (see rule <a href="#section-603-7a">603.7a</a>) that triggers when that mana is spent. This doesn’t affect the mana’s type.
  .rule_text Example: A player’s mana pool contains <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-r"><span class="sr-only">{R}</span></span><span class="mana mana-cost mana-g"><span class="sr-only">{G}</span></span></span> which can be spent only to cast creature spells. That player activates Doubling Cube’s ability, which reads “<span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-3"><span class="sr-only">{3}</span></span></span>, <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-t"><span class="sr-only">{T}</span></span></span>: Double the amount of each type of unspent mana you have.” The player’s mana pool now has <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-r"><span class="sr-only">{R}</span></span><span class="mana mana-cost mana-r"><span class="sr-only">{R}</span></span><span class="mana mana-cost mana-g"><span class="sr-only">{G}</span></span><span class="mana mana-cost mana-g"><span class="sr-only">{G}</span></span></span> in it, <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-r"><span class="sr-only">{R}</span></span><span class="mana mana-cost mana-g"><span class="sr-only">{G}</span></span></span> of which can be spent on anything.
.rule{id: "section-106-6a"}
  .rule_id 106.6a
  .rule_text Some replacement effects increase the amount of mana produced by a spell or ability. In these cases, any restrictions or additional effects created by the spell or ability will apply to all mana produced. If the spell or ability creates a delayed triggered ability that triggers when the mana is spent, a separate delayed triggered ability is created for each mana produced. If the spell or ability creates a continuous effect or replacement effect if the mana is spent, a separate effect is created once for each mana produced.
.rule{id: "section-106-7"}
  .rule_id 106.7.
  .rule_text Some abilities produce mana based on the type of mana another permanent or permanents “could produce.” The type of mana a permanent could produce at any time includes any type of mana that an ability of that permanent would produce if the ability were to resolve at that time, taking into account any applicable replacement effects in any possible order. Ignore whether any costs of the ability could or could not be paid. If that permanent wouldn’t produce any mana under these conditions, or no type of mana can be defined this way, there’s no type of mana it could produce.
  .rule_text Example: Exotic Orchard has the ability “<span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-t"><span class="sr-only">{T}</span></span></span>: Add one mana of any color that a land an opponent controls could produce.” If your opponent controls no lands, activating Exotic Orchard’s mana ability will produce no mana. The same is true if you and your opponent each control no lands other than Exotic Orchards. However, if you control a Forest and an Exotic Orchard, and your opponent controls an Exotic Orchard, then each Exotic Orchard could produce <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-g"><span class="sr-only">{G}</span></span></span>.
.rule{id: "section-106-8"}
  .rule_id 106.8.
  .rule_text If an effect would add mana represented by a hybrid mana symbol to a player’s mana pool, that player chooses one half of that symbol.

  .rule_text One card (Drain Power) causes one player to lose unspent mana and another to add “the mana lost this way.” (Note that these may be the same player.) This empties the former player’s mana pool and causes the mana emptied this way to be put into the latter player’s mana pool. Which permanents, spells, and/or abilities produced that mana are unchanged, as are any restrictions or additional effects associated with any of that mana.

  .rule_id 107.1a
  .rule_text You can’t choose a fractional number, deal fractional damage, gain fractional life, and so on. If a spell or ability could generate a fractional number, the spell or ability will tell you whether to round up or down.
.rule{id: "section-107-1b"}
  .rule_id 107.1b
  .rule_text Most of the time, the Magic game uses only positive numbers and zero. You can’t choose a negative number, deal negative damage, gain negative life, and so on. However, it’s possible for a game value, such as a creature’s power, to be less than zero. If a calculation or comparison needs to use a negative value, it does so. If a calculation that would determine the result of an effect yields a negative number, zero is used instead, unless that effect doubles or sets to a specific value a player’s life total or the power and/or toughness of a creature or creature card.
  .rule_text Example: If a 3/4 creature gets -5/-0, it’s a -2/4 creature. It doesn’t assign damage in combat. Its total power and toughness is 2. Giving it +3/+0 would raise its power to 1.
  .rule_text Example: Viridian Joiner is a 1/2 creature with the ability “<span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-t"><span class="sr-only">{T}</span></span></span>: Add an amount of <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-g"><span class="sr-only">{G}</span></span></span> equal to Viridian Joiner’s power.” An effect gives it -2/-0, then its ability is activated. The ability adds no mana to your mana pool.
  .rule_text Example: Chameleon Colossus is a 4/4 creature with the ability “<span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-2"><span class="sr-only">{2}</span></span><span class="mana mana-cost mana-g"><span class="sr-only">{G}</span></span><span class="mana mana-cost mana-g"><span class="sr-only">{G}</span></span></span>: Chameleon Colossus gets +X/+X until end of turn, where X is its power.” An effect gives it -6/-0, then its ability is activated. It remains a -2/4 creature. It doesn’t become -4/2.

(See rule <a href="#section-601">601</a>, “Casting Spells.”) While a spell is on the stack, any X in its mana cost or in any alternative cost or additional cost it has equals the announced value. While an activated ability is on the stack, any X in its activation cost equals the announced value.

.rule{id: "section-107-3f"}
  .rule_id 107.3f
  .rule_text Sometimes X appears in the text of a spell or ability but not in a mana cost, alternative cost, additional cost, or activation cost.

  .rule_text Most Magic games use only traditional Magic cards, which measure approximately 2.5 inches (6.3 cm) by 3.5 inches (8.8 cm). Traditional Magic cards are included in players’ decks. Certain formats also use nontraditional Magic cards. Nontraditional Magic cards are not included in players’ decks. They may be used in supplementary decks.

  .rule_text The owner of a card in the game is the player who started the game with it in their deck. If a card is brought into the game from outside the game rather than starting in a player’s deck, its owner is the player who brought it into the game. If a card starts the game in the command zone, its owner is the player who put it into the command zone to start the game. Legal ownership of a card in the game is irrelevant to the game rules except for the rules for ante. (See rule <a href="#section-407">407</a>.)

  .rule_text Some spells and abilities allow a player to take cards they own from outside the game and bring them into the game. (See rule <a href="#section-400-11b">400.11b</a>.) If a card outside that game is involved in a Magic game, its owner is determined as described in rule <a href="#section-108-3">108.3</a>. If a card outside that game is in the sideboard of a Magic game (see rule <a href="#section-100-4">100.4</a>), its owner is considered to be the player who started the game with it in their sideboard. In all other cases, the owner of a card outside the game is its legal owner.
.rule{id: "section-108-4"}

  .rule_text The words “you” and “your” on an object refer to the object’s controller, its would-be controller (if a player is attempting to play, cast, or activate it), or its owner (if it has no controller). For a static ability, this is the current controller of the object it’s on. For an activated ability, this is the player who activated the ability. For a triggered ability, this is the controller of the object when the ability triggered, unless it’s a delayed triggered ability.

  .rule_text Permanents
.rule{id: "section-110-1"}
  .rule_id 110.1.
  .rule_text A permanent is a card or token on the battlefield. A permanent remains on the battlefield indefinitely. A card or token becomes a permanent as it enters the battlefield and it stops being a permanent as it’s moved to another zone by an effect or rule.
.rule{id: "section-110-2"}
  .rule_id 110.2.
  .rule_text A permanent’s owner is the same as the owner of the card that represents it (unless it’s a token; see rule <a href="#section-111-2">111.2</a>). A permanent’s controller is, by default, the player under whose control it entered the battlefield. Every permanent has a controller.
.rule{id: "section-110-2a"}
  .rule_id 110.2a
  .rule_text If an effect instructs a player to put an object onto the battlefield, that object enters the battlefield under that player’s control unless the effect states otherwise.
.rule{id: "section-110-2b"}
  .rule_id 110.2b
  .rule_text If an effect causes a player to gain control of another player’s permanent spell, the first player controls the permanent that spell becomes, but the permanent’s controller by default is the player who put that spell onto the stack. (This distinction is relevant in multiplayer games; see rule <a href="#section-800-4c">800.4c</a>.)
.rule{id: "section-110-3"}
  .rule_id 110.3.
  .rule_text A nontoken permanent’s characteristics are the same as those printed on its card, as modified by any continuous effects. See rule <a href="#section-613">613</a>, “Interaction of Continuous Effects.”
.rule{id: "section-110-4"}
  .rule_id 110.4.
  .rule_text There are six permanent types: artifact, battle, creature, enchantment, land, and planeswalker. Instant and sorcery cards can’t enter the battlefield and thus can’t be permanents. Some tribal cards can enter the battlefield and some can’t, depending on their other card types. See section 3, “Card Types.”
.rule{id: "section-110-4a"}
  .rule_id 110.4a
  .rule_text The term “permanent card” is used to refer to a card that could be put onto the battlefield. Specifically, it means an artifact, battle, creature, enchantment, land, or planeswalker card.
.rule{id: "section-110-4b"}
  .rule_id 110.4b
  .rule_text The term “permanent spell” is used to refer to a spell that will enter the battlefield as a permanent as part of its resolution. Specifically, it means an artifact, battle, creature, enchantment, or planeswalker spell.
.rule{id: "section-110-4c"}
  .rule_id 110.4c
  .rule_text If a permanent somehow loses all its permanent types, it remains on the battlefield. It’s still a permanent.
.rule{id: "section-110-5"}
  .rule_id 110.5.
  .rule_text A permanent’s status is its physical state. There are four status categories, each of which has two possible values: tapped/untapped, flipped/unflipped, face up/face down, and phased in/phased out. Each permanent always has one of these values for each of these categories.
.rule{id: "section-110-5a"}
  .rule_id 110.5a
  .rule_text Status is not a characteristic, though it may affect a permanent’s characteristics.
.rule{id: "section-110-5b"}
  .rule_id 110.5b
  .rule_text Permanents enter the battlefield untapped, unflipped, face up, and phased in unless a spell or ability says otherwise.
.rule{id: "section-110-5c"}
  .rule_id 110.5c
  .rule_text A permanent retains its status until a spell, ability, or turn-based action changes it, even if that status is not relevant to it.
  .rule_text Example: Dimir Doppelganger says “<span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-1"><span class="sr-only">{1}</span></span><span class="mana mana-cost mana-u"><span class="sr-only">{U}</span></span><span class="mana mana-cost mana-b"><span class="sr-only">{B}</span></span></span>: Exile target creature card from a graveyard. Dimir Doppelganger becomes a copy of that card and gains this ability.” It becomes a copy of Jushi Apprentice, a flip card. Through use of Jushi Apprentice’s ability, this creature flips, making it a copy of Tomoya the Revealer with the Dimir Doppelganger ability. If this permanent then becomes a copy of Runeclaw Bear, it will retain its flipped status even though that has no relevance to Runeclaw Bear. If its copy ability is activated again, this time targeting a Nezumi Shortfang card (another flip card), this permanent’s flipped status means it will have the characteristics of Stabwhisker the Odious (the flipped version of Nezumi Shortfang) with the Dimir Doppelganger ability.
.rule{id: "section-110-5d"}
  .rule_id 110.5d
  .rule_text Only permanents have status. Cards not on the battlefield do not. Although an exiled card may be face down, this has no correlation to the face-down status of a permanent. Similarly, cards not on the battlefield are neither tapped nor untapped, regardless of their physical state.
.rule{id: "section-111"}
  .rule_id 111.
  .rule_text Tokens
.rule{id: "section-111-1"}
  .rule_id 111.1.
  .rule_text Some effects put tokens onto the battlefield. A token is a marker used to represent any permanent that isn’t represented by a card.
.rule{id: "section-111-2"}
  .rule_id 111.2.
  .rule_text The player who creates a token is its owner. The token enters the battlefield under that player’s control.
.rule{id: "section-111-3"}
  .rule_id 111.3.
  .rule_text The spell or ability that creates a token may define the values of any number of characteristics for the token. This becomes the token’s “text.” The characteristic values defined this way are functionally equivalent to the characteristic values that are printed on a card; for example, they define the token’s copiable values. A token doesn’t have any characteristics not defined by the spell or ability that created it.
  .rule_text Example: Jade Mage has the ability “<span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-2"><span class="sr-only">{2}</span></span><span class="mana mana-cost mana-g"><span class="sr-only">{G}</span></span></span>: Create a 1/1 green Saproling creature token.” The resulting token has no mana cost, supertypes, rules text, or abilities.
.rule{id: "section-111-4"}
  .rule_id 111.4.
  .rule_text A spell or ability that creates a token sets both its name and its subtype(s). If the spell or ability doesn’t specify the name of the token, its name is the same as its subtype(s) plus the word “Token.” Once a token is on the battlefield, changing its name doesn’t change its subtype(s), and vice versa.
  .rule_text Example: Dwarven Reinforcements is a sorcery that says, in part, “Create two 2/1 red Dwarf Berserker creature tokens.” The tokens created as it resolves are each named Dwarf Berserker Token and each have the creature types Dwarf and Berserker.
  .rule_text Example: Minsc, Beloved Ranger says, in part, “When Minsc, Beloved Ranger enters the battlefield, create Boo, a legendary 1/1 red Hamster creature token with trample and haste.” That token’s subtype is Hamster, but because Minsc specifies that the token’s name is Boo, neither “Hamster” nor “Token” are part of its name.
  .rule_text Example: Spitting Image is a sorcery that says, in part, “Create a token that’s a copy of target creature.” All of that token’s characteristics will match the copiable characteristics of the creature targeted by that spell. If Spitting Image targets Doomed Dissenter, a Human creature, the name of the token the spell creates will be Doomed Dissenter, not Human Token or Doomed Dissenter Token.
.rule{id: "section-111-5"}
  .rule_id 111.5.
  .rule_text If a spell or ability would create a token, but a rule or effect states that a permanent with one or more of that token’s characteristics can’t enter the battlefield, the token is not created. Similarly, if an effect would create a token that is a copy of an instant or sorcery card, no token is created.
.rule{id: "section-111-6"}
  .rule_id 111.6.
  .rule_text A token is subject to anything that affects permanents in general or that affects the token’s card type or subtype. A token isn’t a card (even if represented by a card that has a Magic back or that came from a Magic booster pack).
.rule{id: "section-111-7"}
  .rule_id 111.7.
  .rule_text A token that’s in a zone other than the battlefield ceases to exist. This is a state-based action; see rule <a href="#section-704">704</a>. (Note that if a token changes zones, applicable triggered abilities will trigger before the token ceases to exist.)
.rule{id: "section-111-8"}
  .rule_id 111.8.
  .rule_text A token that has left the battlefield can’t move to another zone or come back onto the battlefield. If such a token would change zones, it remains in its current zone instead. It ceases to exist the next time state-based actions are checked; see rule <a href="#section-704">704</a>.
.rule{id: "section-111-9"}
  .rule_id 111.9.
  .rule_text Some effects instruct a player to create a legendary token. These may be written “create [name], a . . .” and list characteristics for the token. This is the same as an instruction to create a token with the listed characteristics that has the given name. 
.rule{id: "section-111-10"}
  .rule_id 111.10.
  .rule_text Some effects instruct a player to create a predefined token. These effects use the definition below to determine the characteristics the token is created with. The effect that creates a predefined token may also modify or add to the predefined characteristics.

.rule{id: "section-111-11"}
  .rule_id 111.11.
  .rule_text If an effect instructs a player to create a token that is a copy of a nonexistent object, no token is created (see rule <a href="#section-707">707</a>, “Copying Objects”). This does not apply to an effect that would use the last known information of an object.
  .rule_text Example: Mimic Vat has a triggered ability whose effect gives you the option to exile a card and an activated ability that says “Create a token that’s a copy of a card exiled with Mimic Vat. It gains haste. Exile it at the beginning of the next end step.” If no card has been exiled with Mimic Vat’s triggered ability, no token is created.

As the first step of being cast (see rule <a href="#section-601">601</a>, “Casting Spells”), the card becomes a spell and is moved to the top of the stack from the zone it was in, which is usually its owner’s hand. (See rule <a href="#section-405">405</a>, “Stack.”) A spell remains on the stack as a spell until it resolves (see rule <a href="#section-608">608</a>, “Resolving Spells and Abilities”), is countered (see rule <a href="#section-701-5">701.5</a>), or otherwise leaves the stack.

  .rule_text A spell’s owner is the same as the owner of the card that represents it, unless it’s a copy. In that case, the owner of the spell is the player under whose control it was put on the stack. A spell’s controller is, by default, the player who put it on the stack. Every spell has a controller.
.rule{id: "section-112-2a"}
  .rule_id 112.2a
  .rule_text Some effects instruct a player to create a copy of a card and say they may cast it. In that case, the owner of that copy is the player who is instructed to create it and given permission to cast it.
.rule{id: "section-112-3"}
  .rule_id 112.3.
  .rule_text A noncopy spell’s characteristics are the same as those printed on its card, as modified by any continuous effects. See rule <a href="#section-613">613</a>, “Interaction of Continuous Effects.”
.rule{id: "section-112-4"}
  .rule_id 112.4.
  .rule_text If an effect of a resolving spell or ability changes any characteristics of a permanent spell, the effect continues to apply to the permanent when the spell resolves. See rule <a href="#section-400-7">400.7</a>.
  .rule_text Example: If an effect changes a black creature spell to white, the creature is white when it enters the battlefield and remains white for the duration of the effect changing its color.

  .rule_text An ability can be one of three things:
.rule{id: "section-113-1a"}
  .rule_id 113.1a
  .rule_text An ability can be a characteristic an object has that lets it affect the game. An object’s abilities are defined by its rules text or by the effect that created it. Abilities can also be granted to objects by rules or effects. (Effects that grant abilities usually use the words “has,” “have,” “gains,” or “gain.”) Abilities generate effects. (See rule <a href="#section-609">609</a>, “Effects.”)
.rule{id: "section-113-1b"}
  .rule_id 113.1b
  .rule_text An ability can be something that a player has that changes how the game affects the player. A player normally has no abilities unless granted to that player by effects.
.rule{id: "section-113-1c"}
  .rule_id 113.1c
  .rule_text An ability can be an activated or triggered ability on the stack. This kind of ability is an object. (See section 6, “Spells, Abilities, and Effects.”)
.rule{id: "section-113-2"}
  .rule_id 113.2.
  .rule_text Abilities can affect the objects they’re on. They can also affect other objects and/or players.
.rule{id: "section-113-2a"}
  .rule_id 113.2a
  .rule_text Abilities can be beneficial or detrimental.
  .rule_text Example: “[This creature] can’t block” is an ability.
.rule{id: "section-113-2b"}
  .rule_id 113.2b
  .rule_text An additional cost or alternative cost to cast a card is an ability of the card.
.rule{id: "section-113-2c"}
  .rule_id 113.2c
  .rule_text An object may have multiple abilities. If the object is represented by a card, then aside from certain defined abilities that may be strung together on a single line (see rule <a href="#section-702">702</a>, “Keyword Abilities”), each paragraph break in a card’s text marks a separate ability. If the object is not represented by a card, the effect that created it may have given it multiple abilities. An object may also be granted additional abilities by a spell or ability. If an object has multiple instances of the same ability, each instance functions independently. This may or may not produce more effects than a single instance; refer to the specific ability for more information.
.rule{id: "section-113-2d"}
  .rule_id 113.2d
  .rule_text Abilities can generate one-shot effects or continuous effects. Some continuous effects are replacement effects or prevention effects. See rule <a href="#section-609">609</a>, “Effects.”
.rule{id: "section-113-3"}
  .rule_id 113.3.
  .rule_text There are four general categories of abilities:
.rule{id: "section-113-3a"}
  .rule_id 113.3a
  .rule_text Spell abilities are abilities that are followed as instructions while an instant or sorcery spell is resolving. Any text on an instant or sorcery spell is a spell ability unless it’s an activated ability, a triggered ability, or a static ability that fits the criteria described in rule <a href="#section-113-6">113.6</a>.
.rule{id: "section-113-3b"}
  .rule_id 113.3b
  .rule_text Activated abilities have a cost and an effect. They are written as “[Cost]: [Effect.] [Activation instructions (if any).]” A player may activate such an ability whenever they have priority. Doing so puts it on the stack, where it remains until it’s countered, it resolves, or it otherwise leaves the stack. See rule <a href="#section-602">602</a>, “Activating Activated Abilities.”
.rule{id: "section-113-3c"}
  .rule_id 113.3c
  .rule_text Triggered abilities have a trigger condition and an effect. They are written as “[Trigger condition], [effect],” and include (and usually begin with) the word “when,” “whenever,” or “at.” Whenever the trigger event occurs, the ability is put on the stack the next time a player would receive priority and stays there until it’s countered, it resolves, or it otherwise leaves the stack. See rule <a href="#section-603">603</a>, “Handling Triggered Abilities.”
.rule{id: "section-113-3d"}
  .rule_id 113.3d
  .rule_text Static abilities are written as statements. They’re simply true. Static abilities create continuous effects which are active while the permanent with the ability is on the battlefield and has the ability, or while the object with the ability is in the appropriate zone. See rule <a href="#section-604">604</a>, “Handling Static Abilities.”
.rule{id: "section-113-4"}
  .rule_id 113.4.
  .rule_text Some activated abilities and some triggered abilities are mana abilities. Mana abilities follow special rules: They don’t use the stack, and, under certain circumstances, a player can activate mana abilities even if they don’t have priority. See rule <a href="#section-605">605</a>, “Mana Abilities.”
.rule{id: "section-113-5"}
  .rule_id 113.5.
  .rule_text Some activated abilities are loyalty abilities. Loyalty abilities follow special rules: A player may activate a loyalty ability of a permanent they control any time they have priority and the stack is empty during a main phase of their turn, but only if no player has previously activated a loyalty ability of that permanent that turn. See rule <a href="#section-606">606</a>, “Loyalty Abilities.”
.rule{id: "section-113-6"}
  .rule_id 113.6.
  .rule_text Abilities of an instant or sorcery spell usually function only while that object is on the stack. Abilities of all other objects usually function only while that object is on the battlefield. The exceptions are as follows:
.rule{id: "section-113-6a"}
  .rule_id 113.6a
  .rule_text Characteristic-defining abilities function everywhere, even outside the game and before the game begins. (See rule <a href="#section-604-3">604.3</a>.)
.rule{id: "section-113-6b"}
  .rule_id 113.6b
  .rule_text An ability that states which zones it functions in functions only from those zones.
.rule{id: "section-113-6c"}
  .rule_id 113.6c
  .rule_text An ability that states which zones it doesn’t function in functions everywhere except for the specified zones, even outside the game and before the game begins.
.rule{id: "section-113-6d"}
  .rule_id 113.6d
  .rule_text An object’s ability that allows a player to pay an alternative cost rather than its mana cost or otherwise modifies what that particular object costs to cast functions on the stack.
.rule{id: "section-113-6e"}
  .rule_id 113.6e
  .rule_text An object’s ability that restricts or modifies how that particular object can be played or cast functions in any zone from which it could be played or cast and also on the stack. An object’s ability that grants it another ability that restricts or modifies how that particular object can be played or cast functions only on the stack.
.rule{id: "section-113-6f"}
  .rule_id 113.6f
  .rule_text An object’s ability that restricts or modifies what zones that particular object can be played or cast from functions everywhere, even outside the game.
.rule{id: "section-113-6g"}
  .rule_id 113.6g
  .rule_text An object’s ability that states it can’t be countered functions on the stack.
.rule{id: "section-113-6h"}
  .rule_id 113.6h
  .rule_text An object’s ability that modifies how that particular object enters the battlefield functions as that object is entering the battlefield. See rule <a href="#section-614-12">614.12</a>.
.rule{id: "section-113-6i"}
  .rule_id 113.6i
  .rule_text An object’s ability that states counters can’t be put on that object functions as that object is entering the battlefield in addition to functioning while that object is on the battlefield.
.rule{id: "section-113-6j"}
  .rule_id 113.6j
  .rule_text An object’s activated ability that has a cost that can’t be paid while the object is on the battlefield functions from any zone in which its cost can be paid.
.rule{id: "section-113-6k"}
  .rule_id 113.6k
  .rule_text A trigger condition that can’t trigger from the battlefield functions in all zones it can trigger from. Other trigger conditions of the same triggered ability may function in different zones.
  .rule_text Example: Absolver Thrull has the ability “When Absolver Thrull enters the battlefield or the creature it haunts dies, destroy target enchantment.” The first trigger condition functions from the battlefield and the second trigger condition functions from the exile zone. (See rule <a href="#section-702-55">702.55</a>, “Haunt.”)
.rule{id: "section-113-6m"}
  .rule_id 113.6m
  .rule_text An ability whose cost or effect specifies that it moves the object it’s on out of a particular zone functions only in that zone, unless its trigger condition or a previous part of its cost or effect specifies that the object is put into that zone or, if the object is an Aura, that the object it enchants leaves the battlefield. The same is true if the effect of that ability creates a delayed triggered ability whose effect moves the object out of a particular zone.
  .rule_text Example: Reassembling Skeleton says “<span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-1"><span class="sr-only">{1}</span></span><span class="mana mana-cost mana-b"><span class="sr-only">{B}</span></span></span>: Return Reassembling Skeleton from your graveyard to the battlefield tapped.” A player may activate this ability only if Reassembling Skeleton is in their graveyard.
.rule{id: "section-113-6n"}
  .rule_id 113.6n
  .rule_text An ability that modifies the rules for deck construction functions before the game begins. Such an ability modifies not just the Comprehensive Rules, but also the Magic: The Gathering Tournament Rules and any other documents that set the deck construction rules for a specific format. However, such an ability can’t affect the format legality of a card, including whether it’s banned or restricted. The current Magic: The Gathering Tournament Rules can be found at WPN.Wizards.com/en/resources/rules-documents.
.rule{id: "section-113-6p"}
  .rule_id 113.6p
  .rule_text Abilities of emblems, plane cards, vanguard cards, scheme cards, and conspiracy cards function in the command zone. See rule <a href="#section-114">114</a>, “Emblems”; rule <a href="#section-901">901</a>, “Planechase”; rule <a href="#section-902">902</a>, “Vanguard”; rule <a href="#section-904">904</a>, “Archenemy”; and rule <a href="#section-905">905</a>, “Conspiracy Draft.”
.rule{id: "section-113-7"}
  .rule_id 113.7.
  .rule_text The source of an ability is the object that generated it. The source of an activated ability on the stack is the object whose ability was activated. The source of a triggered ability (other than a delayed triggered ability) on the stack, or one that has triggered and is waiting to be put on the stack, is the object whose ability triggered. To determine the source of a delayed triggered ability, see rules <a href="#section-603-7d">603.7d</a>–f.
.rule{id: "section-113-7a"}
  .rule_id 113.7a
  .rule_text Once activated or triggered, an ability exists on the stack independently of its source. Destruction or removal of the source after that time won’t affect the ability. Note that some abilities cause a source to do something (for example, “Prodigal Pyromancer deals 1 damage to any target”) rather than the ability doing anything directly. In these cases, any activated or triggered ability that references information about the source for use while announcing an activated ability or putting a triggered ability on the stack checks that information when the ability is put onto the stack. Otherwise, it will check that information when it resolves. In both instances, if the source is no longer in the zone it’s expected to be in at that time, its last known information is used. The source can still perform the action even though it no longer exists.
.rule{id: "section-113-8"}
  .rule_id 113.8.
  .rule_text The controller of an activated ability on the stack is the player who activated it. The controller of a triggered ability on the stack (other than a delayed triggered ability) is the player who controlled the ability’s source when it triggered, or, if it had no controller, the player who owned the ability’s source when it triggered. To determine the controller of a delayed triggered ability, see rules <a href="#section-603-7d">603.7d</a>–f.
.rule{id: "section-113-9"}
  .rule_id 113.9.
  .rule_text Activated and triggered abilities on the stack aren’t spells, and therefore can’t be countered by anything that counters only spells. Activated and triggered abilities on the stack can be countered by effects that specifically counter abilities. Static abilities don’t use the stack and thus can’t be countered at all.
.rule{id: "section-113-10"}
  .rule_id 113.10.
  .rule_text Effects can add or remove abilities of objects. An effect that adds an ability will state that the object “gains” or “has” that ability, or similar. An effect that removes an ability will state that the object “loses” that ability.
.rule{id: "section-113-10a"}
  .rule_id 113.10a
  .rule_text An effect that adds an activated ability may include activation instructions for that ability. These instructions become part of the ability that’s added to the object.
.rule{id: "section-113-10b"}
  .rule_id 113.10b
  .rule_text Effects that remove an ability remove all instances of it.
.rule{id: "section-113-10c"}
  .rule_id 113.10c
  .rule_text If two or more effects add and remove the same ability, in general the most recent one prevails. See rule <a href="#section-613">613</a> for more information about the interaction of continuous effects.
.rule{id: "section-113-11"}
  .rule_id 113.11.
  .rule_text Effects can stop an object from having a specified ability. These effects say that the object “can’t have” that ability. If the object has that ability, it loses it. It’s also impossible for an effect or keyword counter to add that ability to the object. If a resolving spell or ability creates a continuous effect that would add the specified ability to such an object, that part of that continuous effect does not apply; however, other parts of that continuous effect will still apply, and that resolving spell or ability can still create other continuous effects. Continuous effects created by static abilities that would add the specified ability won’t apply to that object.
.rule{id: "section-113-12"}
  .rule_id 113.12.
  .rule_text An effect that sets an object’s characteristic, or simply states a quality of that object, is different from an ability granted by an effect. When an object “gains” or “has” an ability, that ability can be removed by another effect. If an effect defines a characteristic of the object (“[permanent] is [characteristic value]”), it’s not granting an ability. (See rule <a href="#section-604-3">604.3</a>.) Similarly, if an effect states a quality of that object (“[creature] can’t be blocked,” for example), it’s neither granting an ability nor setting a characteristic.
  .rule_text Example: Muraganda Petroglyphs reads, “Creatures with no abilities get +2/+2.” A Runeclaw Bear (a creature with no abilities) enchanted by an Aura that says “Enchanted creature has flying” would not get +2/+2. A Runeclaw Bear enchanted by an Aura that says “Enchanted creature is red” or “Enchanted creature can’t be blocked” would get +2/+2.
.rule{id: "section-114"}
  .rule_id 114.
  .rule_text Emblems
.rule{id: "section-114-1"}
  .rule_id 114.1.
  .rule_text Some effects put emblems into the command zone. An emblem is a marker used to represent an object that has one or more abilities, but no other characteristics.
.rule{id: "section-114-2"}
  .rule_id 114.2.
  .rule_text An effect that creates an emblem is written “[Player] gets an emblem with [ability].” This means that [player] puts an emblem with [ability] into the command zone. The emblem is both owned and controlled by that player.
.rule{id: "section-114-3"}
  .rule_id 114.3.
  .rule_text An emblem has no characteristics other than the abilities defined by the effect that created it. In particular, an emblem has no name, no types, no mana cost, and no color.
.rule{id: "section-114-4"}
  .rule_id 114.4.
  .rule_text Abilities of emblems function in the command zone.
.rule{id: "section-114-5"}
  .rule_id 114.5.
  .rule_text An emblem is neither a card nor a permanent. Emblem isn’t a card type.
.rule{id: "section-115"}
  .rule_id 115.
  .rule_text Targets
.rule{id: "section-115-1"}
  .rule_id 115.1.
  .rule_text Some spells and abilities require their controller to choose one or more targets for them. The targets are object(s) and/or player(s) the spell or ability will affect. These targets are declared as part of the process of putting the spell or ability on the stack. The targets can’t be changed except by another spell or ability that explicitly says it can do so.
.rule{id: "section-115-1a"}
  .rule_id 115.1a
  .rule_text An instant or sorcery spell is targeted if its spell ability identifies something it will affect by using the phrase “target [something],” where the “something” is a phrase that describes an object and/or player. The target(s) are chosen as the spell is cast; see rule <a href="#section-601-2c">601.2c</a>. (If an activated or triggered ability of an instant or sorcery uses the word target, that ability is targeted, but the spell is not.)
  .rule_text Example: A sorcery card has the ability “When you cycle this card, target creature gets -1/-1 until end of turn.” This triggered ability is targeted, but that doesn’t make the card it’s on targeted.
.rule{id: "section-115-1b"}
  .rule_id 115.1b
  .rule_text Aura spells are always targeted. An Aura’s target is specified by its enchant keyword ability (see rule <a href="#section-702-5">702.5</a>, “Enchant”). The target is chosen as the spell is cast; see rule <a href="#section-601-2c">601.2c</a>. An Aura permanent doesn’t target anything; only the spell is targeted. (An activated or triggered ability of an Aura permanent can also be targeted.)
.rule{id: "section-115-1c"}
  .rule_id 115.1c
  .rule_text An activated ability is targeted if it identifies something it will affect by using the phrase “target [something],” where the “something” is a phrase that describes an object and/or player. The target(s) are chosen as the ability is activated; see rule <a href="#section-602-2b">602.2b</a>.
.rule{id: "section-115-1d"}
  .rule_id 115.1d
  .rule_text A triggered ability is targeted if it identifies something it will affect by using the phrase “target [something],” where the “something” is a phrase that describes an object and/or player. The target(s) are chosen as the ability is put on the stack; see rule <a href="#section-603-3d">603.3d</a>.
.rule{id: "section-115-1e"}
  .rule_id 115.1e
  .rule_text Some keyword abilities, such as equip and modular, represent targeted activated or triggered abilities, and some keyword abilities, such as mutate, cause spells to have targets. In those cases, the phrase “target [something]” appears in the rule for that keyword ability rather than in the ability itself. (The keyword’s reminder text will often contain the word “target.”) See rule <a href="#section-702">702</a>, “Keyword Abilities.”
.rule{id: "section-115-2"}
  .rule_id 115.2.
  .rule_text Only permanents are legal targets for spells and abilities, unless a spell or ability (a) specifies that it can target an object in another zone or a player, or (b) targets an object that can’t exist on the battlefield, such as a spell or ability. See also rule <a href="#section-115-4">115.4</a>.
.rule{id: "section-115-3"}
  .rule_id 115.3.
  .rule_text The same target can’t be chosen multiple times for any one instance of the word “target” on a spell or ability. If the spell or ability uses the word “target” in multiple places, the same object or player can be chosen once for each instance of the word “target” (as long as it fits the targeting criteria). This rule applies both when choosing targets for a spell or ability and when changing targets or choosing new targets for a spell or ability (see rule <a href="#section-115-7">115.7</a>).
.rule{id: "section-115-4"}
  .rule_id 115.4.
  .rule_text Some spells and abilities that refer to damage require “any target,” “another target,” “two targets,” or similar rather than “target [something].” These targets may be creatures, players, planeswalkers, or battles. Other game objects, such as noncreature artifacts or spells, can’t be chosen.
.rule{id: "section-115-5"}
  .rule_id 115.5.
  .rule_text A spell or ability on the stack is an illegal target for itself.
.rule{id: "section-115-6"}
  .rule_id 115.6.
  .rule_text A spell or ability that requires targets may allow zero targets to be chosen. Such a spell or ability is still said to require targets, but that spell or ability is targeted only if one or more targets have been chosen for it.
.rule{id: "section-115-7"}
  .rule_id 115.7.
  .rule_text Some effects allow a player to change the target(s) of a spell or ability, and other effects allow a player to choose new targets for a spell or ability.
.rule{id: "section-115-7a"}
  .rule_id 115.7a
  .rule_text If an effect allows a player to “change the target(s)” of a spell or ability, each target can be changed only to another legal target. If a target can’t be changed to another legal target, the original target is unchanged, even if the original target is itself illegal by then. If all the targets aren’t changed to other legal targets, none of them are changed.
.rule{id: "section-115-7b"}
  .rule_id 115.7b
  .rule_text If an effect allows a player to “change a target” of a spell or ability, the process described in rule <a href="#section-115-7a">115.7a</a> is followed, except that only one of those targets may be changed (rather than all of them or none of them).
.rule{id: "section-115-7c"}
  .rule_id 115.7c
  .rule_text If an effect allows a player to “change any targets” of a spell or ability, the process described in rule <a href="#section-115-7a">115.7a</a> is followed, except that any number of those targets may be changed (rather than all of them or none of them).
.rule{id: "section-115-7d"}
  .rule_id 115.7d
  .rule_text If an effect allows a player to “choose new targets” for a spell or ability, the player may leave any number of the targets unchanged, even if those targets would be illegal. If the player chooses to change some or all of the targets, the new targets must be legal and must not cause any unchanged targets to become illegal.
.rule{id: "section-115-7e"}
  .rule_id 115.7e
  .rule_text When changing targets or choosing new targets for a spell or ability, only the final set of targets is evaluated to determine whether the change is legal.
  .rule_text Example: Arc Trail is a sorcery that reads “Arc Trail deals 2 damage to any target and 1 damage to another target.” The current targets of Arc Trail are Runeclaw Bear and Llanowar Elves, in that order. You cast Redirect, an instant that reads “You may choose new targets for target spell,” targeting Arc Trail. You can change the first target to Llanowar Elves and change the second target to Runeclaw Bear.
.rule{id: "section-115-7f"}
  .rule_id 115.7f
  .rule_text A spell or ability may “divide” or “distribute” an effect (such as damage or counters) among one or more targets. When changing targets or choosing new targets for that spell or ability, the original division can’t be changed.
.rule{id: "section-115-8"}
  .rule_id 115.8.
  .rule_text Modal spells and abilities may have different targeting requirements for each mode. An effect that allows a player to change the target(s) of a modal spell or ability, or to choose new targets for a modal spell or ability, doesn’t allow that player to change its mode. (See rule <a href="#section-700-2">700.2</a>.)
.rule{id: "section-115-9"}
  .rule_id 115.9.
  .rule_text Some objects check what another spell or ability is targeting. Depending on the wording, these may check the current state of the targets, the state of the targets at the time they were selected, or both.
.rule{id: "section-115-9a"}
  .rule_id 115.9a
  .rule_text An object that looks for a “[spell or ability] with [a number of] targets” checks the number of times any object or player was chosen as the target of that spell or ability when it was put on the stack, not the number of its targets that are currently legal. If the same object or player became a target more than once, each of those instances is counted separately.
.rule{id: "section-115-9b"}
  .rule_id 115.9b
  .rule_text An object that looks for a “[spell or ability] that targets [something]” checks the current state of that spell or ability’s targets. If an object it targets is still in the zone it’s expected to be in or a player it targets is still in the game, that target’s current information is used, even if it’s not currently legal for that spell or ability. If an object it targets is no longer in the zone it’s expected to be in or a player it targets is no longer in the game, that target is ignored; its last known information is not used.
.rule{id: "section-115-9c"}
  .rule_id 115.9c
  .rule_text An object that looks for a “[spell or ability] that targets only [something]” checks the number of different objects or players that were chosen as targets of that spell or ability when it was put on the stack (as modified by effects that changed those targets), not the number of those objects or players that are currently legal targets. If that number is one (even if the spell or ability targets that object or player multiple times), the current state of that spell or ability’s target is checked as described in rule <a href="#section-115-9b">115.9b</a>.
.rule{id: "section-115-10"}
  .rule_id 115.10.
  .rule_text Spells and abilities can affect objects and players they don’t target. In general, those objects and players aren’t chosen until the spell or ability resolves. See rule <a href="#section-608">608</a>, “Resolving Spells and Abilities.”

  .rule_text Special Actions
.rule{id: "section-116-1"}
  .rule_id 116.1.
  .rule_text Special actions are actions a player may take when they have priority that don’t use the stack. These are not to be confused with turn-based actions and state-based actions, which the game generates automatically. (See rule <a href="#section-703">703</a>, “Turn-Based Actions,” and rule <a href="#section-704">704</a>, “State-Based Actions.”)
.rule{id: "section-116-2"}

  .rule_text There are ten special actions:
.rule{id: "section-116-2a"}
  .rule_id 116.2a
  .rule_text Playing a land is a special action. To play a land, a player puts that land onto the battlefield from the zone it was in (usually that player’s hand). By default, a player can take this action only once during each of their turns. A player can take this action any time they have priority and the stack is empty during a main phase of their turn. See rule <a href="#section-305">305</a>, “Lands.”
.rule{id: "section-116-2b"}
  .rule_id 116.2b
  .rule_text Turning a face-down creature face up is a special action. A player can take this action any time they have priority. See rule <a href="#section-708">708</a>, “Face-Down Spells and Permanents.”
.rule{id: "section-116-2c"}
  .rule_id 116.2c
  .rule_text Some effects allow a player to take an action at a later time, usually to end a continuous effect or to stop a delayed triggered ability from triggering. Doing so is a special action. A player can take such an action any time they have priority, unless that effect specifies another timing restriction, for as long as the effect allows it.
.rule{id: "section-116-2d"}
  .rule_id 116.2d
  .rule_text Some effects from static abilities allow a player to take an action to ignore the effect from that ability for a duration. Doing so is a special action. A player can take such an action any time they have priority.
.rule{id: "section-116-2e"}
  .rule_id 116.2e
  .rule_text One card (Circling Vultures) has the ability “You may discard Circling Vultures any time you could cast an instant.” Doing so is a special action. A player can take such an action any time they have priority.
.rule{id: "section-116-2f"}
  .rule_id 116.2f
  .rule_text A player who has a card with suspend in their hand may exile that card. This is a special action. A player can take this action any time they have priority, but only if they could begin to cast that card by putting it onto the stack. See rule <a href="#section-702-62">702.62</a>, “Suspend.”
.rule{id: "section-116-2g"}
  .rule_id 116.2g
  .rule_text A player who has chosen a companion may pay <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-3"><span class="sr-only">{3}</span></span></span> to put that card from outside the game into their hand. This is a special action. A player can take this action any time they have priority and the stack is empty during a main phase of their turn, but only if they haven’t done so yet this game. (See rule <a href="#section-702-139">702.139</a>, “Companion.”)
.rule{id: "section-116-2h"}
  .rule_id 116.2h
  .rule_text A player who has a card with foretell in their hand may pay <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-2"><span class="sr-only">{2}</span></span></span> and exile that card face down. This is a special action. A player may take this action any time they have priority during their turn. See rule <a href="#section-702-143">702.143</a>, “Foretell.”
.rule{id: "section-116-2i"}
  .rule_id 116.2i
  .rule_text In a Planechase game, rolling the planar die is a special action. A player can take this action any time they have priority and the stack is empty during a main phase of their turn. Taking this action costs a player an amount of mana equal to the number of times they have previously taken this action on that turn. Note that this number won’t be equal to the number of times the player has rolled the planar die that turn if an effect has caused the player to roll the planar die that turn. See rule <a href="#section-901">901</a>, “Planechase.”
.rule{id: "section-116-2j"}
  .rule_id 116.2j
  .rule_text In a Conspiracy Draft game, turning a face-down conspiracy card in the command zone face up is a special action. A player can take this action any time they have priority. See rule <a href="#section-905-4a">905.4a</a>.

  .rule_text Timing and Priority
.rule{id: "section-117-1"}
  .rule_id 117.1.
  .rule_text Unless a spell or ability is instructing a player to take an action, which player can take actions at any given time is determined by a system of priority. The player with priority may cast spells, activate abilities, and take special actions.
.rule{id: "section-117-1a"}
  .rule_id 117.1a
  .rule_text A player may cast an instant spell any time they have priority. A player may cast a noninstant spell during their main phase any time they have priority and the stack is empty.
.rule{id: "section-117-1b"}
  .rule_id 117.1b
  .rule_text A player may activate an activated ability any time they have priority.
.rule{id: "section-117-1c"}
  .rule_id 117.1c
  .rule_text A player may take some special actions any time they have priority. A player may take other special actions during their main phase any time they have priority and the stack is empty. See rule <a href="#section-116">116</a>, “Special Actions.”
.rule{id: "section-117-1d"}
  .rule_id 117.1d
  .rule_text A player may activate a mana ability whenever they have priority, whenever they are casting a spell or activating an ability that requires a mana payment, or whenever a rule or effect asks for a mana payment (even in the middle of casting or resolving a spell or activating or resolving an ability).
.rule{id: "section-117-2"}
  .rule_id 117.2.
  .rule_text Other kinds of abilities and actions are automatically generated or performed by the game rules, or are performed by players without receiving priority.
.rule{id: "section-117-2a"}
  .rule_id 117.2a
  .rule_text Triggered abilities can trigger at any time, including while a spell is being cast, an ability is being activated, or a spell or ability is resolving. (See rule <a href="#section-603">603</a>, “Handling Triggered Abilities.”) However, nothing actually happens at the time an ability triggers. Each time a player would receive priority, each ability that has triggered but hasn’t yet been put on the stack is put on the stack. See rule <a href="#section-117-5">117.5</a>.
.rule{id: "section-117-2b"}
  .rule_id 117.2b
  .rule_text Static abilities continuously affect the game. Priority doesn’t apply to them. (See rule <a href="#section-604">604</a>, “Handling Static Abilities,” and rule <a href="#section-611">611</a>, “Continuous Effects.”)
.rule{id: "section-117-2c"}
  .rule_id 117.2c
  .rule_text Turn-based actions happen automatically when certain steps or phases begin. They’re dealt with before a player would receive priority. See rule <a href="#section-117-3a">117.3a</a>. Turn-based actions also happen automatically when each step and phase ends; no player receives priority afterward. See rule <a href="#section-703">703</a>, “Turn-Based Actions.”
.rule{id: "section-117-2d"}
  .rule_id 117.2d
  .rule_text State-based actions happen automatically when certain conditions are met. See rule <a href="#section-704">704</a>. They’re dealt with before a player would receive priority. See rule <a href="#section-117-5">117.5</a>.
.rule{id: "section-117-2e"}
  .rule_id 117.2e
  .rule_text Resolving spells and abilities may instruct players to make choices or take actions, or may allow players to activate mana abilities. Even if a player is doing so, no player has priority while a spell or ability is resolving. See rule <a href="#section-608">608</a>, “Resolving Spells and Abilities.”
.rule{id: "section-117-3"}
  .rule_id 117.3.
  .rule_text Which player has priority is determined by the following rules:
.rule{id: "section-117-3a"}
  .rule_id 117.3a
  .rule_text The active player receives priority at the beginning of most steps and phases, after any turn-based actions (such as drawing a card during the draw step; see rule <a href="#section-703">703</a>) have been dealt with and abilities that trigger at the beginning of that phase or step have been put on the stack. No player receives priority during the untap step. Players usually don’t get priority during the cleanup step (see rule <a href="#section-514-3">514.3</a>).
.rule{id: "section-117-3b"}
  .rule_id 117.3b
  .rule_text The active player receives priority after a spell or ability (other than a mana ability) resolves.
.rule{id: "section-117-3c"}
  .rule_id 117.3c
  .rule_text If a player has priority when they cast a spell, activate an ability, or take a special action, that player receives priority afterward.
.rule{id: "section-117-3d"}
  .rule_id 117.3d
  .rule_text If a player has priority and chooses not to take any actions, that player passes. If any mana is in that player’s mana pool, they announce what mana is there. Then the next player in turn order receives priority.
.rule{id: "section-117-4"}
  .rule_id 117.4.
  .rule_text If all players pass in succession (that is, if all players pass without taking any actions in between passing), the spell or ability on top of the stack resolves or, if the stack is empty, the phase or step ends.
.rule{id: "section-117-5"}
  .rule_id 117.5.
  .rule_text Each time a player would get priority, the game first performs all applicable state-based actions as a single event (see rule <a href="#section-704">704</a>, “State-Based Actions”), then repeats this process until no state-based actions are performed. Then triggered abilities are put on the stack (see rule <a href="#section-603">603</a>, “Handling Triggered Abilities”). These steps repeat in order until no further state-based actions are performed and no abilities trigger. Then the player who would have received priority does so.
.rule{id: "section-117-6"}
  .rule_id 117.6.
  .rule_text In a multiplayer game using the shared team turns option, teams rather than individual players have priority. See rule <a href="#section-805">805</a>, “Shared Team Turns Option.”
.rule{id: "section-117-7"}
  .rule_id 117.7.
  .rule_text If a player with priority casts a spell or activates an activated ability while another spell or ability is already on the stack, the new spell or ability has been cast or activated “in response to” the earlier spell or ability. The new spell or ability will resolve first. See rule <a href="#section-608">608</a>, “Resolving Spells and Abilities.”
.rule{id: "section-118"}
  .rule_id 118.
  .rule_text Costs
.rule{id: "section-118-1"}
  .rule_id 118.1.
  .rule_text A cost is an action or payment necessary to take another action or to stop another action from taking place. To pay a cost, a player carries out the instructions specified by the spell, ability, or effect that contains that cost.
.rule{id: "section-118-2"}
  .rule_id 118.2.
  .rule_text If a cost includes a mana payment, the player paying the cost has a chance to activate mana abilities. Paying the cost to cast a spell or activate an activated ability follows the steps in rules <a href="#section-601-2f">601.2f</a>–h.
.rule{id: "section-118-3"}
  .rule_id 118.3.
  .rule_text A player can’t pay a cost without having the necessary resources to pay it fully. For example, a player with only 1 life can’t pay a cost of 2 life, and a permanent that’s already tapped can’t be tapped to pay a cost. See rule <a href="#section-202">202</a>, “Mana Cost and Color,” and rule <a href="#section-602">602</a>, “Activating Activated Abilities.”
.rule{id: "section-118-3a"}
  .rule_id 118.3a
  .rule_text Paying mana is done by removing the indicated mana from a player’s mana pool. (Players can always pay 0 mana.) If excess mana remains in that player’s mana pool after making that payment, the player announces what mana is still there.
.rule{id: "section-118-3b"}
  .rule_id 118.3b
  .rule_text Paying life is done by subtracting the indicated amount of life from a player’s life total. (Players can always pay 0 life.)
.rule{id: "section-118-3c"}
  .rule_id 118.3c
  .rule_text Activating mana abilities is not mandatory, even if paying a cost is.
  .rule_text Example: A player controls Lodestone Golem, which says “Nonartifact spells cost <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-1"><span class="sr-only">{1}</span></span></span> more to cast.” Another player removes the last time counter from a suspended sorcery card. That player must cast that spell if able, but doing so costs <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-1"><span class="sr-only">{1}</span></span></span>. The player is forced to pay that cost if enough mana is in their mana pool, but the player isn’t forced to activate a mana ability to produce that mana. If they don’t, the card simply remains exiled.
.rule{id: "section-118-4"}
  .rule_id 118.4.
  .rule_text Some costs include an <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-x"><span class="sr-only">{X}</span></span></span> or an X. See rule <a href="#section-107-3">107.3</a>.
.rule{id: "section-118-5"}
  .rule_id 118.5.
  .rule_text Some costs are represented by <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-0"><span class="sr-only">{0}</span></span></span>, or are reduced to <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-0"><span class="sr-only">{0}</span></span></span>. The action necessary for a player to pay such a cost is the player’s acknowledgment that they are paying it. Even though such a cost requires no resources, it’s not automatically paid.
.rule{id: "section-118-5a"}
  .rule_id 118.5a
  .rule_text A spell whose mana cost is <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-0"><span class="sr-only">{0}</span></span></span> must still be cast the same way as one with a cost greater than zero; it won’t cast itself automatically. The same is true for an activated ability whose cost is <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-0"><span class="sr-only">{0}</span></span></span>.
.rule{id: "section-118-6"}
  .rule_id 118.6.
  .rule_text Some objects have no mana cost. This represents an unpayable cost. An ability can also have an unpayable cost if its cost is based on the mana cost of an object with no mana cost. Attempting to cast a spell or activate an ability that has an unpayable cost is a legal action. However, attempting to pay an unpayable cost is an illegal action.
.rule{id: "section-118-6a"}
  .rule_id 118.6a
  .rule_text If an unpayable cost is increased by an effect or an additional cost is imposed, the cost is still unpayable. If an alternative cost is applied to an unpayable cost, including an effect that allows a player to cast a spell without paying its mana cost, the alternative cost may be paid.
.rule{id: "section-118-7"}
  .rule_id 118.7.
  .rule_text What a player actually needs to do to pay a cost may be changed or reduced by effects. If the mana component of a cost is reduced to nothing by cost reduction effects, it’s considered to be <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-0"><span class="sr-only">{0}</span></span></span>. Paying a cost changed or reduced by an effect counts as paying the original cost.
.rule{id: "section-118-7a"}
  .rule_id 118.7a
  .rule_text Effects that reduce a cost by an amount of generic mana affect only the generic mana component of that cost. They can’t affect the colored or colorless mana components of that cost.
.rule{id: "section-118-7b"}
  .rule_id 118.7b
  .rule_text If a cost is reduced by an amount of colored or colorless mana, but the cost doesn’t require mana of that type, the cost is reduced by that amount of generic mana.
.rule{id: "section-118-7c"}
  .rule_id 118.7c
  .rule_text If a cost is reduced by an amount of colored mana that exceeds its mana component of that color, the cost’s mana component of that color is reduced to nothing and the cost’s generic mana component is reduced by the difference.
.rule{id: "section-118-7d"}
  .rule_id 118.7d
  .rule_text If a cost is reduced by an amount of colorless mana that exceeds its colorless mana component, the cost’s colorless mana component is reduced to nothing and the cost’s generic mana component is reduced by the difference.
.rule{id: "section-118-7e"}
  .rule_id 118.7e
  .rule_text If a cost is reduced by an amount of mana represented by a hybrid mana symbol, the player paying that cost chooses one half of that symbol at the time the cost reduction is applied (see rule <a href="#section-601-2f">601.2f</a>). If a colored half is chosen, the cost is reduced by one mana of that color. If a generic half is chosen, the cost is reduced by an amount of generic mana equal to that half’s number.
.rule{id: "section-118-7f"}
  .rule_id 118.7f
  .rule_text If a cost is reduced by an amount of mana represented by a Phyrexian mana symbol, the cost is reduced by one mana of that symbol’s color.
.rule{id: "section-118-7g"}
  .rule_id 118.7g
  .rule_text If a cost is reduced by an amount of mana represented by one or more snow mana symbols, the cost is reduced by that much generic mana.
.rule{id: "section-118-8"}
  .rule_id 118.8.
  .rule_text Some spells and abilities have additional costs. An additional cost is a cost listed in a spell’s rules text, or applied to a spell or ability from another effect, that its controller must pay at the same time they pay the spell’s mana cost or the ability’s activation cost. Note that some additional costs are listed in keywords; see rule <a href="#section-702">702</a>.
.rule{id: "section-118-8a"}
  .rule_id 118.8a
  .rule_text Any number of additional costs may be applied to a spell as it’s being cast or to an ability as it’s being activated. The controller of the spell or ability announces their intentions to pay any or all of those costs as described in rule <a href="#section-601-2b">601.2b</a>.
.rule{id: "section-118-8b"}
  .rule_id 118.8b
  .rule_text Some additional costs are optional.
.rule{id: "section-118-8c"}
  .rule_id 118.8c
  .rule_text If an effect instructs a player to cast a spell “if able,” and that spell has a mandatory additional cost that includes actions involving cards with a stated quality in a hidden zone, the player isn’t required to cast that spell, even if those cards are present in that zone.
.rule{id: "section-118-8d"}
  .rule_id 118.8d
  .rule_text Additional costs don’t change a spell’s mana cost, only what its controller has to pay to cast it. Spells and abilities that ask for that spell’s mana cost still see the original value.
.rule{id: "section-118-9"}
  .rule_id 118.9.
  .rule_text Some spells have alternative costs. An alternative cost is a cost listed in a spell’s text, or applied to it from another effect, that its controller may pay rather than paying the spell’s mana cost. Alternative costs are usually phrased, “You may [action] rather than pay [this object’s] mana cost,” or “You may cast [this object] without paying its mana cost.” Note that some alternative costs are listed in keywords; see rule <a href="#section-702">702</a>.
.rule{id: "section-118-9a"}
  .rule_id 118.9a
  .rule_text Only one alternative cost can be applied to any one spell as it’s being cast. The controller of the spell announces their intentions to pay that cost as described in rule <a href="#section-601-2b">601.2b</a>.
.rule{id: "section-118-9b"}
  .rule_id 118.9b
  .rule_text Alternative costs are generally optional. An effect that allows you to cast a spell may require a certain alternative cost to be paid.
.rule{id: "section-118-9c"}
  .rule_id 118.9c
  .rule_text An alternative cost doesn’t change a spell’s mana cost, only what its controller has to pay to cast it. Spells and abilities that ask for that spell’s mana cost still see the original value.
.rule{id: "section-118-9d"}
  .rule_id 118.9d
  .rule_text If an alternative cost is being paid to cast a spell, any additional costs, cost increases, and cost reductions that affect that spell are applied to that alternative cost. (See rule <a href="#section-601-2f">601.2f</a>.)
.rule{id: "section-118-10"}
  .rule_id 118.10.
  .rule_text Each payment of a cost applies to only one spell, ability, or effect. For example, a player can’t sacrifice just one creature to activate the activated abilities of two permanents that each require sacrificing a creature as a cost. Also, the resolution of a spell or ability doesn’t pay another spell or ability’s cost, even if part of its effect is doing the same thing the other cost asks for.
.rule{id: "section-118-11"}
  .rule_id 118.11.
  .rule_text The actions performed when paying a cost may be modified by effects. Even if they are, meaning the actions that are performed don’t match the actions that are called for, the cost has still been paid.
  .rule_text Example: A player controls Psychic Vortex, an enchantment with a cumulative upkeep cost of “Draw a card,” and Obstinate Familiar, a creature that says “If you would draw a card, you may skip that draw instead.” The player may decide to pay Psychic Vortex’s cumulative upkeep cost and then draw no cards instead of drawing the appropriate amount. The cumulative upkeep cost has still been paid.
.rule{id: "section-118-12"}
  .rule_id 118.12.
  .rule_text Some spells, activated abilities, and triggered abilities read, “[Do something]. If [a player] [does, doesn’t, or can’t], [effect].” Or “[A player] may [do something]. If [that player] [does, doesn’t, or can’t], [effect].” The action [do something] is a cost, paid when the spell or ability resolves. The “If [a player] [does, doesn’t, or can’t]” clause checks whether the player chose to pay an optional cost or started to pay a mandatory cost, regardless of what events actually occurred.
  .rule_text Example: You control Standstill, an enchantment that says “When a player casts a spell, sacrifice Standstill. If you do, each of that player’s opponents draws three cards.” A spell is cast, causing Standstill’s ability to trigger. Then an ability is activated that exiles Standstill. When Standstill’s ability resolves, you’re unable to pay the “sacrifice Standstill” cost. No player will draw cards.
  .rule_text Example: Your opponent has cast Gather Specimens, a spell that says “If a creature would enter the battlefield under an opponent’s control this turn, it enters the battlefield under your control instead.” You control a face-down Dermoplasm, a creature with morph that says “When Dermoplasm is turned face up, you may put a creature card with morph from your hand onto the battlefield face up. If you do, return Dermoplasm to its owner’s hand.” You turn Dermoplasm face up, and you choose to put a creature card with morph from your hand onto the battlefield. Due to Gather Specimens, it enters the battlefield under your opponent’s control instead of yours. However, since you chose to pay the cost, Dermoplasm is still returned to its owner’s hand.
.rule{id: "section-118-12a"}
  .rule_id 118.12a
  .rule_text Some spells, activated abilities, and triggered abilities read, “[Do something] unless [a player does something else].” This means the same thing as “[A player may do something else]. If [that player doesn’t], [do something].”
.rule{id: "section-118-12b"}
  .rule_id 118.12b
  .rule_text Some effects offer a player a choice to search a zone and take additional actions with the cards found in that zone, followed by an “If [a player] does” clause. This clause checks whether the player chose to search, not whether the player took any of the additional actions.
.rule{id: "section-118-13"}
  .rule_id 118.13.
  .rule_text Some costs contain mana symbols that can be paid in multiple ways. These include hybrid mana symbols and Phyrexian mana symbols.
.rule{id: "section-118-13a"}
  .rule_id 118.13a
  .rule_text If the mana cost of a spell or the activation cost of an activated ability contains a mana symbol that can be paid in multiple ways, the choice of how to pay for that symbol is made as its controller proposes that spell or ability (see rule <a href="#section-601-2b">601.2b</a>).
.rule{id: "section-118-13b"}
  .rule_id 118.13b
  .rule_text If a cost paid during the resolution of a spell or ability contains a mana symbol that can be paid in multiple ways, the player paying that cost chooses how to pay for that symbol immediately before they pay that cost.
.rule{id: "section-118-13c"}
  .rule_id 118.13c

  .rule_text Damage is processed in a four-part sequence.
.rule{id: "section-120-4a"}
  .rule_id 120.4a
  .rule_text First, if an effect that’s causing damage to be dealt states that excess damage that would be dealt to a permanent is dealt to another permanent or player instead, the damage event is modified accordingly. If the first permanent is a creature, the excess damage is the amount of damage in excess of what would be lethal damage, taking into account damage already marked on the creature and damage from other sources that would be dealt at the same time. (See rule <a href="#section-120-6">120.6</a>.) Any amount of damage greater than 1 is excess damage if the source dealing that damage to a creature has deathtouch. (See rule <a href="#section-702-2">702.2</a>.) If the first permanent is a planeswalker, the excess damage is the amount of damage in excess of that planeswalker’s loyalty, taking into account damage from other sources that would be dealt at the same time. If the first permanent is a battle, the excess damage is the amount of damage in excess of that battle’s defense, taking into account damage from other sources that would be dealt at the same time. If the first permanent has multiple card types from among the list of creature, planeswalker, and battle, the excess damage is the greatest of the calculated amounts for each of the card types it has.
.rule{id: "section-120-4b"}
  .rule_id 120.4b
  .rule_text Second, damage is dealt, as modified by replacement and prevention effects that interact with damage. (See rule <a href="#section-614">614</a>, “Replacement Effects,” and rule <a href="#section-615">615</a>, “Prevention Effects.”) Abilities that trigger when damage is dealt trigger now and wait to be put on the stack.
.rule{id: "section-120-4c"}
  .rule_id 120.4c
  .rule_text Third, damage that’s been dealt is processed into its results, as modified by replacement effects that interact with those results (such as life loss or counters).
.rule{id: "section-120-4d"}
  .rule_id 120.4d
  .rule_text Finally, the damage event occurs.
  .rule_text Example: A player who controls Boon Reflection, an enchantment that says “If you would gain life, you gain twice that much life instead,” attacks with a 3/3 creature with wither and lifelink. It’s blocked by a 2/2 creature, and the defending player casts a spell that prevents the next 2 damage that would be dealt to the blocking creature. The damage event starts out as [3 damage is dealt to the 2/2 creature, 2 damage is dealt to the 3/3 creature]. The prevention effect is applied, so the damage event becomes [1 damage is dealt to the 2/2 creature, 2 damage is dealt to the 3/3 creature]. That’s processed into its results, so the damage event is now [one -1/-1 counter is put on the 2/2 creature, the active player gains 1 life, 2 damage is marked on the 3/3 creature]. Boon Reflection’s effect is applied, so the damage event becomes [one -1/-1 counter is put on the 2/2 creature, the active player gains 2 life, 2 damage is marked on the 3/3 creature]. Then the damage event occurs.
  .rule_text Example: The defending player controls a creature and Worship, an enchantment that says “If you control a creature, damage that would reduce your life total to less than 1 reduces it to 1 instead.” That player is at 2 life, and is being attacked by two unblocked 5/5 creatures. The player casts Awe Strike, which says “The next time target creature would deal damage this turn, prevent that damage. You gain life equal to the damage prevented this way,” targeting one of the attackers. The damage event starts out as [10 damage is dealt to the defending player]. Awe Strike’s effect is applied, so the damage event becomes [5 damage is dealt to the defending player, the defending player gains 5 life]. That’s processed into its results, so the damage event is now [the defending player loses 5 life, the defending player gains 5 life]. Worship’s effect sees that the damage event would not reduce the player’s life total to less than 1, so Worship’s effect is not applied. Then the damage event occurs.
.rule{id: "section-120-5"}
  .rule_id 120.5.
  .rule_text Damage dealt to a creature, planeswalker, or battle doesn’t destroy it. Likewise, the source of that damage doesn’t destroy it. Rather, state-based actions may destroy a creature or otherwise put a permanent into its owner’s graveyard, due to the results of the damage dealt to that permanent. See rule <a href="#section-704">704</a>.
  .rule_text Example: A player casts Lightning Bolt, an instant that says “Lightning Bolt deals 3 damage to any target,” targeting a 2/2 creature. After Lightning Bolt deals 3 damage to that creature, the creature is destroyed as a state-based action. Neither Lightning Bolt nor the damage dealt by Lightning Bolt destroyed that creature.
.rule{id: "section-120-6"}
  .rule_id 120.6.
  .rule_text Damage marked on a creature remains until the cleanup step, even if that permanent stops being a creature. If the total damage marked on a creature is greater than or equal to its toughness, that creature has been dealt lethal damage and is destroyed as a state-based action (see rule <a href="#section-704">704</a>). All damage marked on a permanent is removed when it regenerates (see rule <a href="#section-701-15">701.15</a>, “Regenerate”) and during the cleanup step (see rule <a href="#section-514-2">514.2</a>).
.rule{id: "section-120-7"}
  .rule_id 120.7.
  .rule_text The source of damage is the object that dealt it. If an effect requires a player to choose a source of damage, they may choose a permanent; a spell on the stack (including a permanent spell); any object referred to by an object on the stack, by a prevention or replacement effect that’s waiting to apply, or by a delayed triggered ability that’s waiting to trigger (even if that object is no longer in the zone it used to be in); or a face-up object in the command zone. A source doesn’t need to be capable of dealing damage to be a legal choice. See rule <a href="#section-609-7">609.7</a>, “Sources of Damage.”
.rule{id: "section-120-8"}
  .rule_id 120.8.
  .rule_text If a source would deal 0 damage, it does not deal damage at all. That means abilities that trigger on damage being dealt won’t trigger. It also means that replacement effects that would increase the damage dealt by that source, or would have that source deal that damage to a different object or player, have no event to replace, so they have no effect.
.rule{id: "section-120-9"}
  .rule_id 120.9.
  .rule_text If an ability triggers on damage being dealt by a specific source or sources, and the effect refers to the “damage dealt,” it refers only to the damage dealt by the specified sources and not to any damage dealt at the same time by other sources.
.rule{id: "section-120-10"}
  .rule_id 120.10.
  .rule_text Some triggered abilities check whether a permanent has been dealt excess damage. These abilities check after the permanent has been dealt damage by one or more sources. If those sources together dealt an amount of damage to a creature greater than lethal damage, excess damage equal to the difference was dealt to that creature. If those sources together dealt an amount of damage to a planeswalker greater than that planeswalker’s loyalty before the damage was dealt, excess damage equal to the difference was dealt to that planeswalker. If those sources together dealt an amount of damage to a battle greater than that battle’s defense before the damage was dealt, excess damage equal to the difference was dealt to that battle. If a permanent has multiple card types from among the list of creature, planeswalker, and battle, the excess damage dealt to that permanent is the greatest of the calculated amounts for each of the card types it has.

  .rule_text Drawing a Card
.rule{id: "section-121-1"}
  .rule_id 121.1.
  .rule_text A player draws a card by putting the top card of their library into their hand. This is done as a turn-based action during each player’s draw step. It may also be done as part of a cost or effect of a spell or ability.
.rule{id: "section-121-2"}
  .rule_id 121.2.
  .rule_text Cards may only be drawn one at a time. If a player is instructed to draw multiple cards, that player performs that many individual card draws.
.rule{id: "section-121-2a"}
  .rule_id 121.2a
  .rule_text An instruction to draw multiple cards can be modified by replacement effects that refer to the number of cards drawn. This modification occurs before considering any of the individual card draws. See rule <a href="#section-616-1g">616.1g</a>.
.rule{id: "section-121-2b"}
  .rule_id 121.2b
  .rule_text Some effects say that a player can’t draw more than one card each turn. Such an effect applies to individual card draws. Instructions to draw multiple cards may still be partially carried out. However, if an effect offers the player a choice to draw multiple cards, the affected player can’t choose to do so. Similarly, the player can’t pay a cost that includes drawing multiple cards.
.rule{id: "section-121-2c"}
  .rule_id 121.2c
  .rule_text If more than one player is instructed to draw cards, the active player performs all of their draws first, then each other player in turn order does the same.
.rule{id: "section-121-2d"}
  .rule_id 121.2d
  .rule_text If more than one player is instructed to draw cards in a game that’s using the shared team turns option (such as a Two-Headed Giant game), first each player on the active team, in whatever order that team likes, performs their draws, then each player on each nonactive team in turn order does the same.
.rule{id: "section-121-3"}
  .rule_id 121.3.
  .rule_text If there are no cards in a player’s library and an effect offers that player the choice to draw a card, that player can choose to do so. However, if an effect says that a player can’t draw cards and another effect offers that player the choice to draw a card, that player can’t choose to do so.
.rule{id: "section-121-3a"}
  .rule_id 121.3a
  .rule_text The same principles apply if the player who’s making the choice is not the player who would draw the card. If the latter player has no cards in their library, the choice can be taken. If an effect says that the latter player can’t draw a card, the choice can’t be taken.
.rule{id: "section-121-4"}
  .rule_id 121.4.
  .rule_text A player who attempts to draw a card from a library with no cards in it loses the game the next time a player would receive priority. (This is a state-based action. See rule <a href="#section-704">704</a>.)
.rule{id: "section-121-5"}
  .rule_id 121.5.
  .rule_text If an effect moves cards from a player’s library to that player’s hand without using the word “draw,” the player has not drawn those cards. This makes a difference for abilities that trigger on drawing cards and effects that replace card draws, as well as if the player’s library is empty.
.rule{id: "section-121-6"}
  .rule_id 121.6.
  .rule_text Some effects replace card draws.
.rule{id: "section-121-6a"}

  .rule_text If an effect replaces a draw within a sequence of card draws, the replacement effect is completed before resuming the sequence.
.rule{id: "section-121-6c"}
  .rule_id 121.6c
  .rule_text Some effects perform additional actions on a card after it’s drawn. If the draw is replaced, the additional action is not performed on any cards that are drawn as a result of that replacement effect or any subsequent replacement effects.
.rule{id: "section-121-7"}
  .rule_id 121.7.
  .rule_text Some replacement effects and prevention effects result in one or more card draws. In such a case, if there are any parts of the original event that haven’t been replaced, those parts occur first, then the card draws happen one at a time.
.rule{id: "section-121-8"}
  .rule_id 121.8.
  .rule_text If a spell or ability causes a card to be drawn while another spell is being cast, the drawn card is kept face down until that spell becomes cast (see rule <a href="#section-601-2i">601.2i</a>) or until the casting process is reversed (see rule <a href="#section-728">728</a>, “Handling Illegal Actions”). The same is true with relation to another ability being activated. If an effect allows or instructs a player to reveal the card as it’s being drawn, it’s revealed after the spell becomes cast or the ability becomes activated. While face down, the drawn card is considered to have no characteristics and can’t be used to pay any part of the cost of the spell or ability that would require the card to have specific characteristics.
.rule{id: "section-121-9"}
  .rule_id 121.9.

  .rule_id 122.1.
  .rule_text A counter is a marker placed on an object or player that modifies its characteristics and/or interacts with a rule, ability, or effect.

.rule{id: "section-122-1a"}
  .rule_id 122.1a
  .rule_text A +X/+Y counter on a creature or on a creature card in a zone other than the battlefield, where X and Y are numbers, adds X to that object’s power and Y to that object’s toughness.

.rule{id: "section-122-1b"}
  .rule_id 122.1b
  .rule_text A keyword counter on a permanent or on a card in a zone other than the battlefield causes that object to gain that keyword. The keywords that a keyword counter can be are flying, first strike, double strike, deathtouch, haste, hexproof, indestructible, lifelink, menace, reach, trample, and vigilance, as well as any variants of those keywords. See rule <a href="#section-613-1f">613.1f</a>.
.rule{id: "section-122-1c"}

.rule{id: "section-122-5"}
  .rule_id 122.5.
  .rule_text If an effect says to “move” a counter, it means to remove that counter from the object it’s currently on and put it onto a second object. If either of these actions isn’t possible, it’s not possible to move a counter, and no counter is removed from or put onto anything. This may occur if the first and second objects are the same object; if the first object doesn’t have the appropriate kind of counter on it; if the second object can’t have counters put onto it; or if either object is no longer in the correct zone.
.rule{id: "section-122-6"}

  .rule_text Stickers are found in boosters of the Unfinity expansion on numbered inserts. Each insert has a predetermined combination of stickers. Any rule that refers to a sticker sheet refers to the specific combination of stickers found on one of those inserts. Sticker sheets are not cards and have no characteristics. Each sticker sheet can be found at Gatherer.Wizards.com.

  .rule_id 123.2a
  .rule_text In constructed play, a player who chooses to play with stickers must start the game with at least ten sticker sheets selected before play begins, and each of their sticker sheets must be unique. There is no maximum number of sticker sheets a player may start the game with. Each player playing with sticker sheets reveals all of their sticker sheets and chooses three of them at random.

  .rule_text If an effect instructs a player to put a sticker on an object, that player chooses a sticker that is not currently on any objects they own from among the stickers they have access to and puts it on that object.
.rule{id: "section-123-3a"}
  .rule_id 123.3a
  .rule_text Each sticker a player has access to is discrete and is distinct from each other sticker they have access to. Two stickers are never considered to be the same sticker, even if they have the same text or information on them.

  .rule_id 123.3c
  .rule_text A sticker may have a ticket cost represented by a number inside a ticket symbol (see rule <a href="#section-107-17a">107.17a</a>). In order to put a sticker with a ticket cost on an object, the player who owns that object must pay that much <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-tk"><span class="sr-only">{TK}</span></span></span>. If they don’t have that much <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-tk"><span class="sr-only">{TK}</span></span></span>, they can’t put that sticker on an object.

.rule{id: "section-123-4"}
  .rule_id 123.4.
  .rule_text Some rules and effects refer to a “stickered” object. An object is “stickered” if it currently has any kind of sticker on it. An object without any stickers on it is not a stickered object, even if it previously had stickers on it.
.rule{id: "section-123-5"}
  .rule_id 123.5.
  .rule_text Stickers on an object are not retained as that object moves to a hidden zone. Stickers are retained as that object moves to a public zone and continue to apply to the new object it becomes in that zone; this is an exception to rule <a href="#section-400-7">400.7</a>.

  .rule_id 123.5a
  .rule_text If one or more cards with stickers on them enter the battlefield as part of a melded permanent, all of those stickers are on the permanent that object becomes on the battlefield. They maintain their relative timestamp order.
.rule{id: "section-123-5b"}
  .rule_id 123.5b
  .rule_text If an object with a sticker on it becomes a component of a merged permanent on the battlefield, that sticker is on that merged permanent.
.rule{id: "section-123-5c"}
  .rule_id 123.5c
  .rule_text If a melded or merged permanent with one or more stickers on it moves from the battlefield to another public zone, only one of the objects it becomes will retain those stickers. Its owner chooses which of the objects it becomes in its new zone retains any stickers that are on it. Effects from those stickers will continue to apply to only that object.
.rule{id: "section-123-6"}
  .rule_id 123.6.
  .rule_text A name sticker consists only of one or more words. A name sticker on a permanent or on a card in a zone other than the battlefield causes the word on that sticker to be added to the text of that object’s name. This is a text-changing effect. See rule <a href="#section-613-1c">613.1c</a> and rule <a href="#section-612">612</a>, “Text-Changing Effects.”
.rule{id: "section-123-6a"}
  .rule_id 123.6a
  .rule_text For the purposes of rules and effects related to name stickers, a “word” in an object’s name is any series of non-space characters that are separated from other non-space characters by one or more spaces. Hyphenated words and words with punctuation are considered to be one word. Blank lines, such as the one in “Wolf in ________ Clothing,” are not considered words in a card’s name.
.rule{id: "section-123-6b"}
  .rule_id 123.6b
  .rule_text As a name sticker is placed on an object, that object’s controller chooses a position in that object’s name for the word in the name sticker to be added, then announces that object’s new name. That word can be added at the beginning of the object’s name or after any number of the other words that are currently in its name. The new name can be further modified by other name stickers. If that object has no name, its name becomes the word added by the name sticker. Name stickers never modify or remove any of the other words in that name.
  .rule_text Example: As a player puts a name sticker with the word “Dark” printed on it onto a creature named Bear Cub, that creature’s controller chooses whether its new name is “Dark Bear Cub,” “Bear Dark Cub,” or “Bear Cub Dark.” They then announce the new name to all players.
.rule{id: "section-123-6c"}
  .rule_id 123.6c
  .rule_text The text that a name sticker is modifying may change due to other effects and/or a permanent’s face-down status (see rule <a href="#section-708">708</a>, “Face-Down Spells and Permanents”). To determine the name of an object with one or more name stickers, start with the object’s copiable values, then apply each name sticker’s effect and each other text-changing effect in timestamp order. The position of each name sticker will continue to be after the number of words that were before it in the object’s name when it was placed. If there are fewer words in the object’s current name, the word on that sticker is added at the end of its name instead. The position and timestamp order of each name sticker on an object is remembered as the object that sticker is on moves from one public zone to another, and it continues to apply to the new object it becomes in that zone (see rule <a href="#section-123-5">123.5</a>). This is an exception to rule <a href="#section-400-7">400.7</a>.
  .rule_text Example: Fae of Wishes, an adventurer card, is in exile with a name sticker on it adding the word “Mana” after its second word, so its name is “Fae of Mana Wishes.” An effect allows that player to cast Granted, its Adventure, from exile. The name of that spell on the stack is “Granted Mana.” After that card is exiled as the Adventure resolves, the sticker’s position (after the second word) is remembered, so the name of the exiled card is once again “Fae of Mana Wishes.”
  .rule_text Example: A player owns a creature named It That Betrays on the battlefield. Using name stickers, they add the word “Eldrazi” to its name after the third word, such that its new name is “It That Betrays Eldrazi.” Later, that creature becomes a copy of a creature named Seeker of the Way. The name sticker continues to apply after the third word, so its new name is “Seeker of the Eldrazi Way.”
  .rule_text Example: A creature with a name sticker on it becomes enchanted by Witness Protection, an Aura that changes the creature’s name to “Legitimate Businessperson.” Since Witness Protection is also a text-changing effect, and it has a later timestamp than the name sticker, the word on that name sticker is not part of the creature’s name. Its name is “Legitimate Businessperson.”
.rule{id: "section-123-6d"}
  .rule_id 123.6d
  .rule_text Some effects refer to the number of one or more specific letters on a name sticker. A lowercase letter and its uppercase equivalent are the same letter.
.rule{id: "section-123-6e"}
  .rule_id 123.6e
  .rule_text Some effects refer to the number of “unique vowels” on a name sticker. These count the number of different vowels that appear on that sticker, even if one or more of them appear more than once. The vowels are A, E, I, O, U, and Y. A lowercase letter and its uppercase equivalent are the same letter.
.rule{id: "section-123-7"}
  .rule_id 123.7.
  .rule_text An ability sticker is a sticker with one or more abilities printed on it. An ability sticker on a permanent or on a card in a zone other than the battlefield causes that object to gain the ability that is printed on that sticker. See rule <a href="#section-613-1f">613.1f</a>.
.rule{id: "section-123-7a"}
  .rule_id 123.7a
  .rule_text If an effect refers to an ability of an ability sticker, it refers to the ability that sticker grants to the object it is on, even if the object it is on doesn’t currently have that ability due to another effect.
.rule{id: "section-123-8"}
  .rule_id 123.8.
  .rule_text A power and toughness sticker is a sticker that has two numbers and a slash printed on it, resembling the power and toughness of a creature card. A power and toughness sticker on a creature or on a creature or Vehicle card in a zone other than the battlefield sets that object’s power and toughness to the values printed on that sticker (see rule <a href="#section-613-4b">613.4b</a>). If more than one power and toughness sticker is on a creature, use timestamp order to determine which one takes precedence (see rule <a href="#section-613-7">613.7</a>).
.rule{id: "section-123-8a"}
  .rule_id 123.8a
  .rule_text An effect that refers to the power and/or toughness of a sticker refers only to the printed power and/or toughness values on a power and toughness sticker. It does not refer to any printed value on any other stickers.
.rule{id: "section-123-9"}
  .rule_id 123.9.
  .rule_text An art sticker on a permanent has no effect on game play other than to act as a marker that other spells and abilities can identify.

  .rule_text The parts of a card are name, mana cost, illustration, color indicator, type line, expansion symbol, text box, power and toughness, loyalty, hand modifier, life modifier, illustration credit, legal text, and collector number. Some cards may have more than one of any or all of these parts.
.rule{id: "section-200-2"}

  .rule_id 201.2.
  .rule_text A card’s name is always considered to be the English version of its name, regardless of printed language.
.rule{id: "section-201-2a"}
  .rule_id 201.2a
  .rule_text Two or more objects have the same name if they have at least one name in common, even if one or more of those objects have additional names. An object with no name doesn’t have the same name as any other object, including another object with no name.
.rule{id: "section-201-2b"}
  .rule_id 201.2b
  .rule_text Some spells and abilities refer to two or more objects with different names. Those objects have different names only if each of them has at least one name and no two objects in that group have a name in common.
  .rule_text Example: A player controls Liliana’s Contract, which says, in part, “At the beginning of your upkeep, if you control four or more Demons with different names, you win the game.” That player controls three Demons with different names and a face-down creature with no name, with an effect making it a Demon. Because the four creatures include one with no name, those four creatures don’t count as four Demons with different names. The ability of Liliana’s Contract won’t trigger.
.rule{id: "section-201-2c"}
  .rule_id 201.2c
  .rule_text Some spells or abilities check if one object has a different name than a second object or group of objects. The first object has a different name than those objects if the first object has at least one name and has no names in common with any of the other objects, even if one or more of the other objects have no names. If the first object has no name, it does not have a different name than any of the other objects, even if those other objects themselves have names.
.rule{id: "section-201-3"}
  .rule_id 201.3.
  .rule_text Some cards with different English names are treated as though they had the same English name. Pairs of cards with this property have names that are interchangeable.
.rule{id: "section-201-3a"}
  .rule_id 201.3a
  .rule_text For the purposes of all rules, abilities, and effects that refer to a card’s name, objects with interchangeable names have the same name. (See rules <a href="#section-201-2a">201.2a</a>–b.)
.rule{id: "section-201-3b"}
  .rule_id 201.3b
  .rule_text For the purposes of deck construction and format legality, cards with interchangeable names have the same name.
.rule{id: "section-201-3c"}
  .rule_id 201.3c
  .rule_text If a card has later printings with interchangeable names, the later printings will have an interchangeable names indicator in the bottom left-hand corner referring to the original printing’s three-letter set code and collector number (see rule <a href="#section-213-1d">213.1d</a>).
.rule{id: "section-201-4"}
  .rule_id 201.4.
  .rule_text If an effect instructs a player to choose a card name, the player must choose the name of a card in the Oracle card reference. (See rule <a href="#section-108-1">108.1</a>.) A player may not choose the name of a token unless it’s also the name of a card.
.rule{id: "section-201-4a"}
  .rule_id 201.4a
  .rule_text If a player is instructed to choose a card name with certain characteristics, the player must choose the name of a card whose Oracle text matches those characteristics. (See rule <a href="#section-108-1">108.1</a>.)
  .rule_text Example: Dispossess reads, in part, “Choose an artifact card name.” The player can choose the name of any artifact card, even one that’s not legal in the format of the current game. The player can’t choose Island, even if an Island on the battlefield has been turned into artifact by some effect.
.rule{id: "section-201-4b"}
  .rule_id 201.4b
  .rule_text If a player wants to choose the name of a split card, the player must choose the name of one of its halves, but not both. (See rule <a href="#section-709">709</a>.) If a player is instructed to choose a card name with certain characteristics, use only that half’s characteristics to determine if this name can be chosen.
.rule{id: "section-201-4c"}
  .rule_id 201.4c
  .rule_text If a player wants to choose a flip card’s alternative name, the player may do so. (See rule <a href="#section-710">710</a>.) If a player is instructed to choose a card name with certain characteristics, use the card’s characteristics as modified by its alternative characteristics to determine if this name can be chosen.
.rule{id: "section-201-4d"}
  .rule_id 201.4d
  .rule_text If a player wants to choose the name of the back face of a double-faced card, the player may do so. (See rule <a href="#section-712">712</a>.) If a player is instructed to choose a card name with certain characteristics, use only the characteristics of the back face to determine if this name can be chosen.
.rule{id: "section-201-4e"}

.rule{id: "section-201-4g"}
  .rule_id 201.4g
  .rule_text Some cards have interchangeable names (see rule <a href="#section-201-3">201.3</a>). For all game purposes, these cards have the same name. If a player chooses the name of a card which has interchangeable names, the name of each of those cards has been chosen.
.rule{id: "section-201-5"}
  .rule_id 201.5.
  .rule_text Text that refers to the object it’s on by name means just that particular object and not any other objects with that name, regardless of any name changes caused by game effects.
.rule{id: "section-201-5a"}
  .rule_id 201.5a
  .rule_text If an ability’s effect grants another ability to an object, and that second ability refers to that first ability’s source by name, the name refers only to the specific object which is that first ability’s source. The second ability does not refer to any other object with the same name as the first ability’s source. However, if the second ability also moved the first ability’s source to a different public zone, the name refers to the object the source became in its new zone. This is also true if the second ability is copied onto a new object.
  .rule_text Example: Gutter Grime has an ability that reads “Whenever a nontoken creature you control dies, put a slime counter on Gutter Grime, then create a green Ooze creature token with ‘This creature’s power and toughness are each equal to the number of slime counters on Gutter Grime.’” The ability granted to the token only looks at the Gutter Grime that created the token, not at any other Gutter Grime on the battlefield. A copy of that token would also have an ability that referred only to the Gutter Grime that created the original token.
.rule{id: "section-201-5b"}
  .rule_id 201.5b
  .rule_text If an ability of an object refers to that object by name, and an object with a different name gains that ability, each instance of the first name in the gained ability that refers to the first object by name should be treated as the second name.
  .rule_text Example: Quicksilver Elemental says, in part, “<span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-u"><span class="sr-only">{U}</span></span></span>: Quicksilver Elemental gains all activated abilities of target creature until end of turn.” If it gains an ability that says “<span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-g"><span class="sr-only">{G}</span></span></span>: Regenerate Cudgel Troll,” activating that ability will regenerate Quicksilver Elemental, not the Cudgel Troll it gained the ability from.
  .rule_text Example: Glacial Ray is an instant with splice onto Arcane that says “Glacial Ray deals 2 damage to any target.” If it’s spliced onto a Kodama’s Reach, that Kodama’s Reach deals 2 damage to the target.
  .rule_text Example: Dimir Doppelganger says “<span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-1"><span class="sr-only">{1}</span></span><span class="mana mana-cost mana-u"><span class="sr-only">{U}</span></span><span class="mana mana-cost mana-b"><span class="sr-only">{B}</span></span></span>: Exile target creature card from a graveyard. Dimir Doppelganger becomes a copy of that card and gains this ability.” Dimir Doppelganger’s ability is activated targeting a Runeclaw Bear card. The Doppelganger becomes a copy of Runeclaw Bear and gains an ability that should be treated as saying “<span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-1"><span class="sr-only">{1}</span></span><span class="mana mana-cost mana-u"><span class="sr-only">{U}</span></span><span class="mana mana-cost mana-b"><span class="sr-only">{B}</span></span></span>: Exile target creature card from a graveyard. Runeclaw Bear becomes a copy of that card and gains this ability.”
.rule{id: "section-201-5c"}
  .rule_id 201.5c
  .rule_text Text printed on some legendary cards refers to that card by a shortened version of its name. Instances of a card’s shortened name used in this manner are treated as though they used the card’s full name.
.rule{id: "section-201-6"}
  .rule_id 201.6.
  .rule_text Promotional or alternate-art versions of some cards feature a secondary title bar below the name line. The card’s name as listed in the Oracle card reference is displayed in the secondary title bar, and an alternate name appears in the upper left corner. For the purposes of deck construction, game rules, and effects, these cards have only the card name specified in the secondary title bar. Rules text may also refer to a card’s alternate name; instances of the alternate name that are present in rules text refer to the name specified in the secondary title bar. The alternate name has no effect on game play.

  .rule_text Mana Cost and Color
.rule{id: "section-202-1"}
  .rule_id 202.1.
  .rule_text A card’s mana cost is indicated by mana symbols near the top of the card. (See rule <a href="#section-107-4">107.4</a>.) On most cards, these symbols are printed in the upper right corner. Some cards from the Future Sight set have alternate frames in which the mana symbols appear to the left of the illustration.
.rule{id: "section-202-1a"}
  .rule_id 202.1a
  .rule_text The mana cost of an object represents what a player must spend from their mana pool to cast that card. Unless an object’s mana cost includes Phyrexian mana symbols (see rule <a href="#section-107-4f">107.4f</a>), paying that mana cost requires matching the type of any colored or colorless mana symbols as well as paying the generic mana indicated in the cost.
.rule{id: "section-202-1b"}
  .rule_id 202.1b
  .rule_text Some objects have no mana cost. This normally includes all land cards, any other cards that have no mana symbols where their mana cost would appear, tokens (unless the effect that creates them specifies otherwise), and nontraditional Magic cards. Having no mana cost represents an unpayable cost (see rule <a href="#section-118-6">118.6</a>). Note that lands are played without paying any costs (see rule <a href="#section-305">305</a>, “Lands”).
.rule{id: "section-202-2"}

  .rule_id 202.2c
  .rule_text An object with two or more different colored mana symbols in its mana cost is each of the colors of those mana symbols. Most multicolored cards are printed with a gold frame, but this is not a requirement for a card to be multicolored.
.rule{id: "section-202-2d"}
  .rule_id 202.2d
  .rule_text An object with one or more hybrid mana symbols and/or Phyrexian mana symbols in its mana cost is all of the colors of those mana symbols, in addition to any other colors the object might be.

  .rule_id 202.3b
  .rule_text The mana value of a transforming double-faced permanent or spell’s back face is calculated as though it had the mana cost of its front face. If a permanent or spell is a copy of the back face of a transforming double-faced card (even if the card representing that copy is itself a double-faced card), the mana value of the copy is 0.
  .rule_text Example: Huntmaster of the Fells is a transforming double-faced card with mana cost <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-2"><span class="sr-only">{2}</span></span><span class="mana mana-cost mana-r"><span class="sr-only">{R}</span></span><span class="mana mana-cost mana-g"><span class="sr-only">{G}</span></span></span>. Its mana value is 4. After it transforms to its other face (Ravager of the Fells), its mana value remains 4.
  .rule_text Example: A Clone enters the battlefield as a copy of Ravager of the Fells. Its mana value is 0.
  .rule_text Example: Insectile Aberration is the back face of a transforming double-faced card whose front face has mana cost <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-u"><span class="sr-only">{U}</span></span></span>. It becomes a copy of Ravager of the Fells. Its mana value becomes 0.

  .rule_id 202.3c
  .rule_text The mana value of a melded permanent is calculated as though it had the combined mana cost of the front faces of each card that represents it. If a permanent is a copy of a melded permanent (even if that copy is represented by two other meld cards), the mana value of the copy is 0.
.rule{id: "section-202-3d"}
  .rule_id 202.3d
  .rule_text The mana value of a split card not on the stack or of a fused split spell on the stack is determined from the combined mana costs of its halves. Otherwise, while a split card is on the stack, the mana value of the spell is determined by the mana cost of the half that was chosen to be cast. See rule <a href="#section-709">709</a>, “Split Cards.”

  .rule_id 202.3e
  .rule_text When calculating the mana value of an object with an <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-x"><span class="sr-only">{X}</span></span></span> in its mana cost, X is treated as 0 while the object is not on the stack, and X is treated as the number chosen for it while the object is on the stack.
.rule{id: "section-202-3f"}
  .rule_id 202.3f
  .rule_text When calculating the mana value of an object with a hybrid mana symbol in its mana cost, use the largest component of each hybrid symbol.
  .rule_text Example: The mana value of a card with mana cost <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-1"><span class="sr-only">{1}</span></span><span class="mana mana-cost mana-wu"><span class="sr-only">{W/U}</span></span><span class="mana mana-cost mana-wu"><span class="sr-only">{W/U}</span></span></span> is 3.
  .rule_text Example: The mana value of a card with mana cost <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-2b"><span class="sr-only">{2/B}</span></span><span class="mana mana-cost mana-2b"><span class="sr-only">{2/B}</span></span><span class="mana mana-cost mana-2b"><span class="sr-only">{2/B}</span></span></span> is 6.
.rule{id: "section-202-3g"}
  .rule_id 202.3g
  .rule_text Each Phyrexian mana symbol in a card’s mana cost contributes 1 to its mana value.
  .rule_text Example: The mana value of a card with mana cost <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-1"><span class="sr-only">{1}</span></span><span class="mana mana-cost mana-wp"><span class="sr-only">{W/P}</span></span><span class="mana mana-cost mana-wp"><span class="sr-only">{W/P}</span></span></span> is 3.
.rule{id: "section-202-4"}
  .rule_id 202.4.
  .rule_text Any additional cost listed in an object’s rules text or imposed by an effect isn’t part of the mana cost. (See rule <a href="#section-601">601</a>, “Casting Spells.”) Such costs are paid at the same time as the spell’s other costs.

  .rule_text Illustration
.rule{id: "section-203-1"}
  .rule_id 203.1.
  .rule_text The illustration is printed on the upper half of a card and has no effect on game play. For example, a creature doesn’t have the flying ability unless stated in its rules text, even if it’s depicted as flying.

  .rule_text Color Indicator
.rule{id: "section-204-1"}
  .rule_id 204.1.
  .rule_text The color indicator is printed to the left of the type line directly below the illustration. It consists of a circular symbol filled in with one or more colors. A color indicator is usually found on nonland cards without a mana cost.
.rule{id: "section-204-2"}
  .rule_id 204.2.
  .rule_text An object with a color indicator is each color denoted by that color indicator.
.rule{id: "section-205"}
  .rule_id 205.
  .rule_text Type Line
.rule{id: "section-205-1"}
  .rule_id 205.1.
  .rule_text The type line is printed directly below the illustration. It contains the card’s card type(s). It also contains the card’s subtype(s) and supertype(s), if applicable.
.rule{id: "section-205-1a"}
  .rule_id 205.1a
  .rule_text Some effects set an object’s card type. In most such cases, the new card type(s) replaces any existing card types. However, an object with either the instant or sorcery card type retains that type. Counters, stickers, effects, and damage marked on the object remain with it, even if they are meaningless to the new card type. Similarly, when an effect sets one or more of an object’s subtypes, the new subtype(s) replaces any existing subtypes from the appropriate set (creature types, land types, artifact types, enchantment types, planeswalker types, or spell types). If an object’s card type is removed, the subtypes correlated with that card type will remain if they are also the subtypes of a card type the object currently has; otherwise, they are also removed for the entire time the object’s card type is removed. Removing an object’s subtype doesn’t affect its card types at all.
.rule{id: "section-205-1b"}
  .rule_id 205.1b
  .rule_text Some effects change an object’s card type, supertype, or subtype but specify that the object retains a prior card type, supertype, or subtype. In such cases, all the object’s prior card types, supertypes, and subtypes are retained. This rule applies to effects that use the phrase “in addition to its types” or that state that something is “still a [type, supertype, or subtype].” Some effects state that an object becomes an “artifact creature”; these effects also allow the object to retain all of its prior card types and subtypes. Some effects state that an object becomes a “[creature type or types] artifact creature”; these effects also allow the object to retain all of its prior card types and subtypes other than creature types, but replace any existing creature types.
  .rule_text Example: An ability reads, “All lands are 1/1 creatures that are still lands.” The affected lands now have two card types: creature and land. If there were any lands that were also artifacts before the ability’s effect applied to them, those lands would become “artifact land creatures,” not just “creatures,” or “land creatures.” The effect allows them to retain both the artifact and land card types. In addition, each land affected by the ability retains any land types and supertypes it had before the ability took effect.
  .rule_text Example: An ability reads, “All artifacts are 1/1 artifact creatures.” If a permanent is both an artifact and an enchantment, it will become an artifact enchantment creature.

  .rule_id 205.2.
  .rule_text Card Types
.rule{id: "section-205-2a"}
  .rule_id 205.2a
  .rule_text The card types are artifact, battle, conspiracy, creature, dungeon, enchantment, instant, land, phenomenon, plane, planeswalker, scheme, sorcery, tribal, and vanguard. See section 3, “Card Types.”
.rule{id: "section-205-2b"}
  .rule_id 205.2b
  .rule_text Some objects have more than one card type (for example, an artifact creature). Such objects satisfy the criteria for any effect that applies to any of their card types.
.rule{id: "section-205-2c"}
  .rule_id 205.2c
  .rule_text Tokens have card types even though they aren’t cards. The same is true of copies of spells and copies of cards.

  .rule_id 205.3.
  .rule_text Subtypes
.rule{id: "section-205-3a"}
  .rule_id 205.3a
  .rule_text A card can have one or more subtypes printed on its type line.
.rule{id: "section-205-3b"}
  .rule_id 205.3b
  .rule_text Subtypes of each card type except plane are always single words and are listed after a long dash. Each word after the dash is a separate subtype; such objects may have multiple types. Subtypes of planes are also listed after a long dash, but may be multiple words; all words after the dash are, collectively, a single subtype.
  .rule_text Example: “Basic Land — Mountain” means the card is a land with the subtype Mountain. “Creature — Goblin Wizard” means the card is a creature with the subtypes Goblin and Wizard. “Artifact — Equipment” means the card is an artifact with the subtype Equipment.
.rule{id: "section-205-3c"}
  .rule_id 205.3c
  .rule_text If a card with multiple card types has one or more subtypes, each subtype is correlated to its appropriate card type.
  .rule_text Example: Dryad Arbor’s type line says “Land Creature — Forest Dryad.” Forest is a land type, and Dryad is a creature type.
.rule{id: "section-205-3d"}
  .rule_id 205.3d
  .rule_text An object can’t gain a subtype that doesn’t correspond to one of that object’s types.
.rule{id: "section-205-3e"}
  .rule_id 205.3e
  .rule_text If an effect instructs a player to choose a subtype, that player must choose one, and only one, existing subtype, and the subtype must be for the appropriate card type. For example, the player can’t choose a land type if an instruction requires choosing a creature type.
  .rule_text Example: When choosing a creature type, “Merfolk” or “Wizard” is acceptable, but “Merfolk Wizard” is not. Words like “artifact,” “opponent,” “Swamp,” or “truck” can’t be chosen because they aren’t creature types.
.rule{id: "section-205-3f"}
  .rule_id 205.3f
  .rule_text Many cards were printed with subtypes that are now obsolete. Many cards have retroactively received subtypes. Use the Oracle card reference to determine what a card’s subtypes are. (See rule <a href="#section-108-1">108.1</a>.)

Changing an object’s card types or subtypes won’t change its supertypes. Changing an object’s supertypes won’t change its card types or subtypes. When an object gains or loses a supertype, it retains any other supertypes it had.
  .rule_text Example: An ability reads, “All lands are 1/1 creatures that are still lands.” If any of the affected lands were legendary, they are still legendary.
.rule{id: "section-205-4c"}
  .rule_id 205.4c
  .rule_text Any land with the supertype “basic” is a basic land. Any land that doesn’t have this supertype is a nonbasic land, even if it has a basic land type.
  .rule_text      Cards printed in sets prior to the Eighth Edition core set didn’t use the word “basic” to indicate a basic land. Cards from those sets with the following names are basic lands and have received errata in the Oracle card reference accordingly: Forest, Island, Mountain, Plains, Swamp, Snow-Covered Forest, Snow-Covered Island, Snow-Covered Mountain, Snow-Covered Plains, and Snow-Covered Swamp.

  .rule_text The color of the expansion symbol indicates the rarity of the card within its set. A red-orange symbol indicates the card is mythic rare. A gold symbol indicates the card is rare. A silver symbol indicates the card is uncommon. A black or white symbol indicates the card is common or is a basic land. A purple symbol signifies a special rarity; to date, only the Time Spiral® “timeshifted” cards, which were rarer than that set’s rare cards, have had purple expansion symbols. (Prior to the Exodus™ set, all expansion symbols were black, regardless of rarity. Also, prior to the Sixth Edition core set, with the exception of the Simplified Chinese Fifth Edition core set, Magic core sets didn’t have expansion symbols at all.)

  .rule_text The text box is printed on the lower half of the card. It usually contains rules text defining the card’s abilities.
.rule{id: "section-207-2"}
  .rule_id 207.2.
  .rule_text The text box may also contain italicized text that has no game function.
.rule{id: "section-207-2a"}
  .rule_id 207.2a
  .rule_text Reminder text is italicized text within parentheses that summarizes a rule that applies to that card. It usually appears on the same line as the ability it’s relevant to, but it may appear on its own line if it applies to an aspect of the card other than an ability.
.rule{id: "section-207-2b"}
  .rule_id 207.2b
  .rule_text Flavor text is italicized text that, like the illustration, adds artistic appeal to the game. It usually appears below the rules text.
.rule{id: "section-207-2c"}
  .rule_id 207.2c
  .rule_text An ability word appears in italics at the beginning of some abilities. Ability words are similar to keywords in that they tie together cards that have similar functionality, but they have no special rules meaning and no individual entries in the Comprehensive Rules. The ability words are adamant, addendum, alliance, battalion, bloodrush, channel, chroma, cohort, constellation, converge, council’s dilemma, coven, delirium, domain, eminence, enrage, fateful hour, ferocious, formidable, grandeur, hellbent, heroic, imprint, inspired, join forces, kinship, landfall, lieutenant, magecraft, metalcraft, morbid, pack tactics, parley, radiance, raid, rally, revolt, spell mastery, strive, sweep, tempting offer, threshold, undergrowth, and will of the council.
.rule{id: "section-207-2d"}
  .rule_id 207.2d
  .rule_text Similar to ability words, flavor words appear in italics at the beginning of some abilities. Flavor words provide a flavorful description of abilities, but they have no special rules meaning and are not listed in the Comprehensive Rules. While an ability word ties together several abilities with similar functionality, each flavor word is tailored to the specific ability it appears with.
.rule{id: "section-207-3"}
  .rule_id 207.3.
  .rule_text Some cards have decorative icons in the background of their text boxes. For example, a guild icon appears in the text box of many cards associated with the guilds of Ravnica, and a faction icon appears in the text box of most Scars of Mirrodin™ block cards. Similarly, many promotional cards include decorative icons. These icons have no effect on game play.
.rule{id: "section-207-4"}
  .rule_id 207.4.
  .rule_text The chaos symbol appears in the text box of each plane card to the left of a triggered ability that triggers whenever chaos ensues. The symbol itself has no special rules meaning. See rule <a href="#section-901">901</a>, “Planechase.”
.rule{id: "section-207-5"}
  .rule_id 207.5.
  .rule_text One card (Cryptic Spires) has a set of symbols below the text box that represent each color and an ability that instructs a player to circle two of those colors as they create their deck. To circle a color, the player circles (or otherwise clearly indicates) that color’s symbol. The mana symbol of each circled color is considered part of that card’s printed rules text (see rule <a href="#section-613-1">613.1</a>) and affects that card’s color identity (see rule <a href="#section-903-4">903.4</a>).
.rule{id: "section-208"}
  .rule_id 208.
  .rule_text Power/Toughness
.rule{id: "section-208-1"}
  .rule_id 208.1.
  .rule_text A creature card has two numbers separated by a slash printed in its lower right corner. The first number is its power (the amount of damage it deals in combat); the second is its toughness (the amount of damage needed to destroy it). For example, 2/3 means the object has power 2 and toughness 3. Power and toughness can be modified or set to particular values by effects.
.rule{id: "section-208-2"}
  .rule_id 208.2.
  .rule_text Rather than a fixed number, some creature cards have power and/or toughness that includes a star (*).
.rule{id: "section-208-2a"}
  .rule_id 208.2a
  .rule_text The card may have a characteristic-defining ability that sets its power and/or toughness according to some stated condition. (See rule <a href="#section-604-3">604.3</a>.) Such an ability is worded “[This creature’s] [power or toughness] is equal to . . .” or “[This creature’s] power and toughness are each equal to . . .” This ability functions everywhere, even outside the game. If the ability needs to use a number that can’t be determined, including inside a calculation, use 0 instead of that number.
  .rule_text Example: Lost Order of Jarkeld has power and toughness each equal to 1+*. It has the abilities “As Lost Order of Jarkeld enters the battlefield, choose an opponent” and “Lost Order of Jarkeld’s power and toughness are each equal to 1 plus the number of creatures the chosen player controls.” While Lost Order of Jarkeld isn’t on the battlefield, there won’t be a chosen player. Its power and toughness will each be equal to 1 plus 0, so it’s 1/1.
.rule{id: "section-208-2b"}
  .rule_id 208.2b
  .rule_text The card may have a static ability that creates a replacement effect that sets the creature’s power and toughness to one of a number of specific values as it enters the battlefield or is turned face up. (See rule <a href="#section-614">614</a>, “Replacement Effects.”) Such an ability is worded “As [this creature] enters the battlefield . . . ,” “As [this creature] is turned face up . . . ,” or “[This creature] enters the battlefield as . . .” and lists two or more specific power and toughness values (and may also list additional characteristics). The characteristics chosen or determined with these effects affect the creature’s copiable values. (See rule <a href="#section-707-2">707.2</a>.) While the card isn’t on the battlefield, its power and toughness are each considered to be 0.
.rule{id: "section-208-3"}
  .rule_id 208.3.
  .rule_text A noncreature permanent has no power or toughness, even if it’s a card with a power and toughness printed on it (such as a Vehicle). A noncreature object not on the battlefield has power or toughness only if it has a power and toughness printed on it.
.rule{id: "section-208-3a"}
  .rule_id 208.3a
  .rule_text If an effect would be created that sets the base power and/or toughness of a noncreature permanent, or otherwise modifies its power and/or toughness, that effect is created even though it doesn’t do anything unless that permanent becomes a creature.
  .rule_text Example: Veteran Motorist has the ability “Whenever Veteran Motorist crews a Vehicle, that Vehicle gets +1/+1 until end of turn,” and it’s tapped to pay the crew cost of a Vehicle. This triggered ability resolves while the Vehicle it crewed isn’t yet a creature. The continuous effect is created and will apply to the Vehicle once it becomes a creature.
.rule{id: "section-208-4"}
  .rule_id 208.4.
  .rule_text Some effects refer to a creature’s “base power,” “base toughness,” or “base power and toughness.”
.rule{id: "section-208-4a"}
  .rule_id 208.4a
  .rule_text Effects that set a creature’s power and/or toughness to specific values may refer to base power and/or toughness. Other continuous effects may further modify the creature’s power and toughness. See rule <a href="#section-613">613</a>, “Interaction of Continuous Effects.”
.rule{id: "section-208-4b"}
  .rule_id 208.4b
  .rule_text Some effects check a creature’s base power and/or toughness. These effects see that creature’s characteristics after applying any characteristic-defining abilities and abilities that set power and/or toughness, ignoring any effects and counters that modify power and/or toughness without setting them. See rule <a href="#section-613">613</a>, “Interaction of Continuous Effects.”
.rule{id: "section-208-5"}
  .rule_id 208.5.
  .rule_text If a creature somehow has no value for its power, its power is 0. The same is true for toughness.
.rule{id: "section-209"}
  .rule_id 209.
  .rule_text Loyalty
.rule{id: "section-209-1"}
  .rule_id 209.1.
  .rule_text Each planeswalker card has a loyalty number printed in its lower right corner. This indicates its loyalty while it’s not on the battlefield, and it also indicates that the planeswalker enters the battlefield with that many loyalty counters on it (see rule <a href="#section-306-5b">306.5b</a>).
.rule{id: "section-209-2"}
  .rule_id 209.2.
  .rule_text An activated ability with a loyalty symbol in its cost is a loyalty ability. Loyalty abilities follow special rules: A player may activate a loyalty ability of a permanent they control any time they have priority and the stack is empty during a main phase of their turn, but only if none of that permanent’s loyalty abilities have been activated that turn. See rule <a href="#section-606">606</a>, “Loyalty Abilities.”
.rule{id: "section-210"}
  .rule_id 210.
  .rule_text Defense
.rule{id: "section-210-1"}
  .rule_id 210.1.
  .rule_text Each battle card has a defense number printed in its lower right corner. This indicates its defense while it’s not on the battlefield, and it also indicates that the battle enters the battlefield with that many defense counters on it (see rule <a href="#section-310-4b">310.4b</a>).
.rule{id: "section-211"}
  .rule_id 211.
  .rule_text Hand Modifier
.rule{id: "section-211-1"}
  .rule_id 211.1.
  .rule_text Each vanguard card has a hand modifier printed in its lower left corner. This is a number preceded by a plus sign, a number preceded by a minus sign, or a zero. This modifier is applied as the starting hand size and the maximum hand size of the vanguard card’s owner are determined. See rule <a href="#section-103-5">103.5</a>.
.rule{id: "section-212"}
  .rule_id 212.
  .rule_text Life Modifier
.rule{id: "section-212-1"}
  .rule_id 212.1.
  .rule_text Each vanguard card has a life modifier printed in its lower right corner. This is a number preceded by a plus sign, a number preceded by a minus sign, or a zero. This modifier is applied as the starting life total of the vanguard card’s owner is determined. See rule <a href="#section-103-4">103.4</a>.
.rule{id: "section-213"}
  .rule_id 213.
  .rule_text Information Below the Text Box
.rule{id: "section-213-1"}
  .rule_id 213.1.
  .rule_text Each card features text printed below the text box that has no effect on game play. Not all card sets were printed with all of the information listed below on each card.
.rule{id: "section-213-1a"}
  .rule_id 213.1a
  .rule_text Most card sets feature collector numbers. This information is printed in the form [card number]/[total cards in the set] or simply [card number]. Some cards, such as unique cards in Planeswalker Decks, have card numbers that exceed the listed total number of cards.
.rule{id: "section-213-1b"}
  .rule_id 213.1b
  .rule_text A card’s rarity is indicated with a single letter following the collector number.
.rule{id: "section-213-1c"}
  .rule_id 213.1c
  .rule_text Some promotional cards include information to indicate the specific promotion the card is associated with.
.rule{id: "section-213-1d"}
  .rule_id 213.1d
  .rule_text Some cards with interchangeable names include information about a specific version of a card with that interchangeable name. See rule <a href="#section-201-3">201.3</a>.
.rule{id: "section-213-1e"}
  .rule_id 213.1e
  .rule_text The three-character code representing the set in which a card is printed and the two-character code representing the language in which a card is printed are separated by a bullet point. If a card is premium, these codes are instead separated by a star.
.rule{id: "section-213-1f"}
  .rule_id 213.1f
  .rule_text The illustration credit for a card follows the paintbrush icon or, on older cards, the abbreviation “Illus.”
.rule{id: "section-213-1g"}
  .rule_id 213.1g
  .rule_text Legal text (the fine print at the bottom or bottom-right of the card) lists the trademark and copyright information.
.rule{id: "section-3"}
  .rule_id 3.
  .rule_text Card Types
.rule{id: "section-300"}
  .rule_id 300.
  .rule_text General
.rule{id: "section-300-1"}
  .rule_id 300.1.
  .rule_text The card types are artifact, conspiracy, creature, dungeon, enchantment, instant, land, phenomenon, plane, planeswalker, scheme, sorcery, tribal, and vanguard.
.rule{id: "section-300-2"}
  .rule_id 300.2.
  .rule_text Some objects have more than one card type (for example, an artifact creature). Such objects combine the aspects of each of those card types, and are subject to spells and abilities that affect either or all of those card types.
.rule{id: "section-300-2a"}
  .rule_id 300.2a
  .rule_text An object that’s both a land and another card type (for example, an artifact land) can only be played as a land. It can’t be cast as a spell.
.rule{id: "section-300-2b"}
  .rule_id 300.2b
  .rule_text Each tribal card has another card type. Casting and resolving a tribal card follow the rules for casting and resolving a card of the other card type.
.rule{id: "section-301"}
  .rule_id 301.
  .rule_text Artifacts
.rule{id: "section-301-1"}
  .rule_id 301.1.
  .rule_text A player who has priority may cast an artifact card from their hand during a main phase of their turn when the stack is empty. Casting an artifact as a spell uses the stack. (See rule <a href="#section-601">601</a>, “Casting Spells.”)
.rule{id: "section-301-2"}
  .rule_id 301.2.
  .rule_text When an artifact spell resolves, its controller puts it onto the battlefield under their control.
.rule{id: "section-301-3"}
  .rule_id 301.3.
  .rule_text Artifact subtypes are always a single word and are listed after a long dash: “Artifact — Equipment.” Artifact subtypes are also called artifact types. Artifacts may have multiple subtypes. See rule <a href="#section-205-3g">205.3g</a> for the complete list of artifact types.
.rule{id: "section-301-4"}
  .rule_id 301.4.
  .rule_text Artifacts have no characteristics specific to their card type. Most artifacts have no colored mana symbols in their mana costs, and are therefore colorless. However, there is no correlation between being colorless and being an artifact: artifacts may be colored, and colorless objects may be card types other than artifact.
.rule{id: "section-301-5"}
  .rule_id 301.5.
  .rule_text Some artifacts have the subtype “Equipment.” An Equipment can be attached to a creature. It can’t legally be attached to anything that isn’t a creature.
.rule{id: "section-301-5a"}
  .rule_id 301.5a
  .rule_text The creature an Equipment is attached to is called the “equipped creature.” The Equipment is attached to, or “equips,” that creature.
.rule{id: "section-301-5b"}
  .rule_id 301.5b
  .rule_text Equipment spells are cast like other artifact spells. Equipment enter the battlefield like other artifacts. They don’t enter the battlefield attached to a creature. The equip keyword ability attaches the Equipment to a creature you control (see rule <a href="#section-702-6">702.6</a>, “Equip”). Control of the creature matters only when the equip ability is activated and when it resolves. Spells and other abilities may also attach an Equipment to a creature. If an effect attempts to attach an Equipment to an object that can’t be equipped by it, the Equipment doesn’t move.
.rule{id: "section-301-5c"}
  .rule_id 301.5c
  .rule_text An Equipment that’s also a creature can’t equip a creature unless that Equipment has reconfigure (see rule <a href="#section-702-151">702.151</a>, “Reconfigure”). An Equipment that loses the subtype “Equipment” can’t equip a creature. An Equipment can’t equip itself. An Equipment that equips an illegal or nonexistent permanent becomes unattached from that permanent but remains on the battlefield. (This is a state-based action. See rule <a href="#section-704">704</a>.) An Equipment can’t equip more than one creature. If a spell or ability would cause an Equipment to equip more than one creature, the Equipment’s controller chooses which creature it equips.
.rule{id: "section-301-5d"}
  .rule_id 301.5d
  .rule_text An Equipment’s controller is separate from the equipped creature’s controller; the two need not be the same. Changing control of the creature doesn’t change control of the Equipment, and vice versa. Only the Equipment’s controller can activate its abilities. However, if the Equipment grants an ability to the equipped creature (with “gains” or “has”), the equipped creature’s controller is the only one who can activate that ability.
.rule{id: "section-301-5e"}
  .rule_id 301.5e
  .rule_text If an effect attempts to put an Equipment that isn’t also an Aura (see rule <a href="#section-303-4i">303.4i</a>) onto the battlefield attached to an object it can’t legally equip, the Equipment enters the battlefield unattached. If the Equipment is a token, it’s created and enters the battlefield unattached.
.rule{id: "section-301-5f"}
  .rule_id 301.5f
  .rule_text An ability of a permanent that refers to the “equipped creature” refers to whatever creature that permanent is attached to, even if the permanent with the ability isn’t an Equipment.
.rule{id: "section-301-6"}
  .rule_id 301.6.
  .rule_text Some artifacts have the subtype “Fortification.” A Fortification can be attached to a land. It can’t legally be attached to an object that isn’t a land. Fortification’s analog to the equip keyword ability is the fortify keyword ability. Rules <a href="#section-301-5a">301.5a</a>–f apply to Fortifications in relation to lands just as they apply to Equipment in relation to creatures, with one clarification relating to rule <a href="#section-301-5c">301.5c</a>: a Fortification that’s also a creature (not a land) can’t fortify a land. (See rule <a href="#section-702-67">702.67</a>, “Fortify.”)
.rule{id: "section-301-7"}
  .rule_id 301.7.
  .rule_text Some artifacts have the subtype “Vehicle.” Most Vehicles have a crew ability which allows them to become artifact creatures. See rule <a href="#section-702-122">702.122</a>, “Crew.”
.rule{id: "section-301-7a"}
  .rule_id 301.7a
  .rule_text Each Vehicle has a printed power and toughness, but it has these characteristics only if it’s also a creature. See rule <a href="#section-208-3">208.3</a>.
.rule{id: "section-301-7b"}
  .rule_id 301.7b
  .rule_text If a Vehicle becomes a creature, it immediately has its printed power and toughness. Other effects, including the effect that makes it a creature, may modify these values or set them to different values.
.rule{id: "section-302"}
  .rule_id 302.
  .rule_text Creatures
.rule{id: "section-302-1"}
  .rule_id 302.1.
  .rule_text A player who has priority may cast a creature card from their hand during a main phase of their turn when the stack is empty. Casting a creature as a spell uses the stack. (See rule <a href="#section-601">601</a>, “Casting Spells.”)
.rule{id: "section-302-2"}
  .rule_id 302.2.
  .rule_text When a creature spell resolves, its controller puts it onto the battlefield under their control.
.rule{id: "section-302-3"}
  .rule_id 302.3.
  .rule_text Creature subtypes are always a single word and are listed after a long dash: “Creature — Human Soldier,” “Artifact Creature — Golem,” and so on. Creature subtypes are also called creature types. Creatures may have multiple subtypes. See rule <a href="#section-205-3m">205.3m</a> for the complete list of creature types.
  .rule_text Example: “Creature — Goblin Wizard” means the card is a creature with the subtypes Goblin and Wizard.
.rule{id: "section-302-4"}
  .rule_id 302.4.
  .rule_text Power and toughness are characteristics only creatures have.
.rule{id: "section-302-4a"}
  .rule_id 302.4a
  .rule_text A creature’s power is the amount of damage it deals in combat.
.rule{id: "section-302-4b"}
  .rule_id 302.4b
  .rule_text A creature’s toughness is the amount of damage needed to destroy it.
.rule{id: "section-302-4c"}
  .rule_id 302.4c
  .rule_text To determine a creature’s power and toughness, start with the numbers printed in its lower right corner, then apply any applicable continuous effects. (See rule <a href="#section-613">613</a>, “Interaction of Continuous Effects.”)
.rule{id: "section-302-5"}
  .rule_id 302.5.
  .rule_text Creatures can attack and block. (See rule <a href="#section-508">508</a>, “Declare Attackers Step,” and rule <a href="#section-509">509</a>, “Declare Blockers Step.”)
.rule{id: "section-302-6"}
  .rule_id 302.6.
  .rule_text A creature’s activated ability with the tap symbol or the untap symbol in its activation cost can’t be activated unless the creature has been under its controller’s control continuously since their most recent turn began. A creature can’t attack unless it has been under its controller’s control continuously since their most recent turn began. This rule is informally called the “summoning sickness” rule.
.rule{id: "section-302-7"}
  .rule_id 302.7.
  .rule_text Damage dealt to a creature by a source with neither wither nor infect is marked on that creature (see rule <a href="#section-120-3">120.3</a>). If the total damage marked on that creature is greater than or equal to its toughness, that creature has been dealt lethal damage and is destroyed as a state-based action (see rule <a href="#section-704">704</a>). All damage marked on a creature is removed when it regenerates (see rule <a href="#section-701-15">701.15</a>, “Regenerate”) and during the cleanup step (see rule <a href="#section-514-2">514.2</a>).
.rule{id: "section-303"}
  .rule_id 303.
  .rule_text Enchantments
.rule{id: "section-303-1"}
  .rule_id 303.1.
  .rule_text A player who has priority may cast an enchantment card from their hand during a main phase of their turn when the stack is empty. Casting an enchantment as a spell uses the stack. (See rule <a href="#section-601">601</a>, “Casting Spells.”)
.rule{id: "section-303-2"}
  .rule_id 303.2.
  .rule_text When an enchantment spell resolves, its controller puts it onto the battlefield under their control.
.rule{id: "section-303-3"}
  .rule_id 303.3.
  .rule_text Enchantment subtypes are always a single word and are listed after a long dash: “Enchantment — Shrine.” Each word after the dash is a separate subtype. Enchantment subtypes are also called enchantment types. Enchantments may have multiple subtypes. See rule <a href="#section-205-3h">205.3h</a> for the complete list of enchantment types.
.rule{id: "section-303-4"}
  .rule_id 303.4.
  .rule_text Some enchantments have the subtype “Aura.” An Aura enters the battlefield attached to an object or player. What an Aura can be attached to is defined by its enchant keyword ability (see rule <a href="#section-702-5">702.5</a>, “Enchant”). Other effects can limit what a permanent can be enchanted by.
.rule{id: "section-303-4a"}
  .rule_id 303.4a
  .rule_text An Aura spell requires a target, which is defined by its enchant ability.
.rule{id: "section-303-4b"}
  .rule_id 303.4b
  .rule_text The object or player an Aura is attached to is called enchanted. The Aura is attached to, or “enchants,” that object or player.
.rule{id: "section-303-4c"}
  .rule_id 303.4c
  .rule_text If an Aura is enchanting an illegal object or player as defined by its enchant ability and other applicable effects, the object it was attached to no longer exists, or the player it was attached to has left the game, the Aura is put into its owner’s graveyard. (This is a state-based action. See rule <a href="#section-704">704</a>.)
.rule{id: "section-303-4d"}
  .rule_id 303.4d
  .rule_text An Aura can’t enchant itself. If this occurs somehow, the Aura is put into its owner’s graveyard. An Aura that’s also a creature can’t enchant anything. If this occurs somehow, the Aura becomes unattached, then is put into its owner’s graveyard. (These are state-based actions. See rule <a href="#section-704">704</a>.) An Aura can’t enchant more than one object or player. If a spell or ability would cause an Aura to become attached to more than one object or player, the Aura’s controller chooses which object or player it becomes attached to.
.rule{id: "section-303-4e"}
  .rule_id 303.4e
  .rule_text An Aura’s controller is separate from the enchanted object’s controller or the enchanted player; the two need not be the same. If an Aura enchants an object, changing control of the object doesn’t change control of the Aura, and vice versa. Only the Aura’s controller can activate its abilities. However, if the Aura grants an ability to the enchanted object (with “gains” or “has”), the enchanted object’s controller is the only one who can activate that ability.
.rule{id: "section-303-4f"}
  .rule_id 303.4f
  .rule_text If an Aura is entering the battlefield under a player’s control by any means other than by resolving as an Aura spell, and the effect putting it onto the battlefield doesn’t specify the object or player the Aura will enchant, that player chooses what it will enchant as the Aura enters the battlefield. The player must choose a legal object or player according to the Aura’s enchant ability and any other applicable effects.
.rule{id: "section-303-4g"}
  .rule_id 303.4g
  .rule_text If an Aura is entering the battlefield and there is no legal object or player for it to enchant, the Aura remains in its current zone, unless that zone is the stack. In that case, the Aura is put into its owner’s graveyard instead of entering the battlefield. If the Aura is a token, it isn’t created.
.rule{id: "section-303-4h"}
  .rule_id 303.4h
  .rule_text If an effect attempts to put a permanent that isn’t an Aura, Equipment, or Fortification onto the battlefield attached to an object or player, it enters the battlefield unattached.
.rule{id: "section-303-4i"}
  .rule_id 303.4i
  .rule_text If an effect attempts to put an Aura onto the battlefield attached to an object or player it can’t legally enchant, the Aura remains in its current zone, unless that zone is the stack. In that case, the Aura is put into its owner’s graveyard instead of entering the battlefield. If the Aura is a token, it isn’t created.
.rule{id: "section-303-4j"}
  .rule_id 303.4j
  .rule_text If an effect attempts to attach an Aura on the battlefield to an object or player it can’t legally enchant, the Aura doesn’t move.

  .rule_id 303.4k
  .rule_text If an effect allows an Aura that’s being turned face up to become attached to an object or player, the Aura’s controller considers the characteristics of that Aura as it would exist if it were face up to determine what it may be attached to, and they must choose a legal object or player according to the Aura’s enchant ability and any other applicable effects.
.rule{id: "section-303-4m"}
  .rule_id 303.4m
  .rule_text An ability of a permanent that refers to the “enchanted [object or player]” refers to whatever object or player that permanent is attached to, even if the permanent with the ability isn’t an Aura.

  .rule_id 304.3.
  .rule_text Instant subtypes are always a single word and are listed after a long dash: “Instant — Arcane.” Each word after the dash is a separate subtype. The set of instant subtypes is the same as the set of sorcery subtypes; these subtypes are called spell types. Instants may have multiple subtypes. See rule <a href="#section-205-3k">205.3k</a> for the complete list of spell types.

  .rule_id 304.5.
  .rule_text If text states that a player may do something “any time they could cast an instant” or “only as an instant,” it means only that the player must have priority. The player doesn’t need to have an instant card they could cast. Effects that would preclude that player from casting an instant spell don’t affect the player’s capability to perform that action (unless the action is actually casting an instant spell).

  .rule_text Lands
.rule{id: "section-305-1"}
  .rule_id 305.1.
  .rule_text A player who has priority may play a land card from their hand during a main phase of their turn when the stack is empty. Playing a land is a special action; it doesn’t use the stack (see rule <a href="#section-116">116</a>). Rather, the player simply puts the land onto the battlefield. Since the land doesn’t go on the stack, it is never a spell, and players can’t respond to it with instants or activated abilities.
.rule{id: "section-305-2"}
  .rule_id 305.2.
  .rule_text A player can normally play one land during their turn; however, continuous effects may increase this number.
.rule{id: "section-305-2a"}
  .rule_id 305.2a
  .rule_text To determine whether a player can play a land, compare the number of lands the player can play this turn with the number of lands they have already played this turn (including lands played as special actions and lands played during the resolution of spells and abilities). If the number of lands the player can play is greater, the play is legal.
.rule{id: "section-305-2b"}
  .rule_id 305.2b
  .rule_text A player can’t play a land, for any reason, if the number of lands the player can play this turn is equal to or less than the number of lands they have already played this turn. Ignore any part of an effect that instructs a player to do so.
.rule{id: "section-305-3"}

.rule{id: "section-305-5"}
  .rule_id 305.5.
  .rule_text Land subtypes are always a single word and are listed after a long dash. Land subtypes are also called land types. Lands may have multiple subtypes. See rule <a href="#section-205-3i">205.3i</a> for the complete list of land types.
  .rule_text Example: “Basic Land — Mountain” means the card is a land with the subtype Mountain.
.rule{id: "section-305-6"}
  .rule_id 305.6.
  .rule_text The basic land types are Plains, Island, Swamp, Mountain, and Forest. If an object uses the words “basic land type,” it’s referring to one of these subtypes. An object with the land card type and a basic land type has the intrinsic ability “<span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-t"><span class="sr-only">{T}</span></span></span>: Add [mana symbol],” even if the text box doesn’t actually contain that text or the object has no text box. For Plains, [mana symbol] is <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-w"><span class="sr-only">{W}</span></span></span>; for Islands, <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-u"><span class="sr-only">{U}</span></span></span>; for Swamps, <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-b"><span class="sr-only">{B}</span></span></span>; for Mountains, <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-r"><span class="sr-only">{R}</span></span></span>; and for Forests, <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-g"><span class="sr-only">{G}</span></span></span>.

.rule{id: "section-305-7"}
  .rule_id 305.7.
  .rule_text If an effect sets a land’s subtype to one or more of the basic land types, the land no longer has its old land type. It loses all abilities generated from its rules text, its old land types, and any copiable effects affecting that land, and it gains the appropriate mana ability for each new basic land type. Note that this doesn’t remove any abilities that were granted to the land by other effects. Setting a land’s subtype doesn’t add or remove any card types (such as creature) or supertypes (such as basic, legendary, and snow) the land may have. If a land gains one or more land types in addition to its own, it keeps its land types and rules text, and it gains the new land types and mana abilities.
.rule{id: "section-305-8"}
  .rule_id 305.8.
  .rule_text Any land with the supertype “basic” is a basic land. Any land that doesn’t have this supertype is a nonbasic land, even if it has a basic land type.

.rule{id: "section-306-4"}
  .rule_id 306.4.
  .rule_text Previously, planeswalkers were subject to a “planeswalker uniqueness rule” that stopped a player from controlling two planeswalkers of the same planeswalker type. This rule has been removed and planeswalker cards printed before this change have received errata in the Oracle card reference to have the legendary supertype.

  .rule_text A planeswalker has the intrinsic ability “This permanent enters the battlefield with a number of loyalty counters on it equal to its printed loyalty number.” This ability creates a replacement effect (see rule <a href="#section-614-1c">614.1c</a>).
.rule{id: "section-306-5c"}

  .rule_text The loyalty of a planeswalker on the battlefield is equal to the number of loyalty counters on it.
.rule{id: "section-306-5d"}
  .rule_id 306.5d
  .rule_text Each planeswalker has a number of loyalty abilities, which are activated abilities with loyalty symbols in their costs. Loyalty abilities follow special rules: A player may activate a loyalty ability of a permanent they control any time they have priority and the stack is empty during a main phase of their turn, but only if none of that permanent’s loyalty abilities have been activated that turn. See rule <a href="#section-606">606</a>, “Loyalty Abilities.”

  .rule_text Previously, planeswalkers were subject to a redirection effect that allowed a player to have noncombat damage that would be dealt to an opponent be dealt to a planeswalker under that opponent’s control instead. This rule has been removed and certain cards have received errata in the Oracle card reference to deal damage directly to planeswalkers.
.rule{id: "section-306-8"}

.rule{id: "section-307-5"}
  .rule_id 307.5.
  .rule_text If a spell, ability, or effect states that a player can do something only “any time they could cast a sorcery” or “only as a sorcery,” it means only that the player must have priority, it must be during the main phase of their turn, and the stack must be empty. The player doesn’t need to have a sorcery card they could cast. Effects that would preclude that player from casting a sorcery spell don’t affect the player’s capability to perform that action (unless the action is actually casting a sorcery spell).
.rule{id: "section-307-5a"}
  .rule_id 307.5a
  .rule_text Similarly, if an effect checks to see if a spell was cast “any time a sorcery couldn’t have been cast,” it’s checking only whether the spell’s controller cast it without having priority, during a phase other than their main phase, or while another object was on the stack.

  .rule_text Each room has a name. These names are considered flavor text and do not affect game play.
.rule{id: "section-309-4c"}
  .rule_id 309.4c
  .rule_text Each room has a triggered ability called a room ability whose effect is printed on the card. They all have the same trigger condition not printed on the card. The full text of each room ability is “When you move your venture marker into this room, [effect.]” As long as a dungeon card is in the command zone, its abilities may trigger. Each room ability is controlled by the player who owns the dungeon card that is that ability’s source.

This ability triggers if the chaos symbol is rolled on the planar die (see rule <a href="#section-901-9b">901.9b</a>), if a resolving spell or ability says that chaos ensues, or if a resolving spell or ability states that chaos ensues for a particular object. In the last case, the chaos ability can trigger even if that plane card is still in the planar deck but revealed. A chaos ability is controlled by the current planar controller.

.rule{id: "section-312-2"}
  .rule_id 312.2.
  .rule_text Phenomenon cards remain in the command zone throughout the game, both while they’re part of a planar deck and while they’re face up. They’re not permanents. They can’t be cast. If a phenomenon card would leave the command zone, it remains in the command zone.

  .rule_text Phenomenon cards have no subtypes.
.rule{id: "section-312-4"}
  .rule_id 312.4.
  .rule_text The controller of a face-up phenomenon card is the player designated as the planar controller. Normally, the planar controller is whoever the active player is. However, if the current planar controller would leave the game, instead the next player in turn order that wouldn’t leave the game becomes the planar controller, then the old planar controller leaves the game. The new planar controller retains that designation until they leave the game or a different player becomes the active player, whichever comes first.
.rule{id: "section-312-5"}
  .rule_id 312.5.
  .rule_text Each phenomenon card has a triggered ability that triggers when you encounter it. “When you encounter [this phenomenon]” means “When you move this card off a planar deck and turn it face up.”

  .rule_id 313.6.
  .rule_text Each vanguard card has a hand modifier printed in its lower left corner. This is a number preceded by a plus sign, a number preceded by a minus sign, or a zero. This modifier is applied to the starting hand size and maximum hand size of the vanguard card’s owner (normally seven). The resulting number is both how many cards that player draws at the beginning of the game and their maximum hand size. See rule <a href="#section-103-5">103.5</a>.
.rule{id: "section-313-7"}
  .rule_id 313.7.
  .rule_text Each vanguard card has a life modifier printed in its lower right corner. This is a number preceded by a plus sign, a number preceded by a minus sign, or a zero.

.rule{id: "section-315-2"}
  .rule_id 315.2.
  .rule_text At the start of a game, before decks are shuffled, each player may put any number of conspiracy cards from their sideboard into the command zone. Conspiracy cards with hidden agenda are put into the command zone face down. (See rule <a href="#section-702-106">702.106</a>, “Hidden Agenda.”)

.rule{id: "section-400"}
  .rule_id 400.
  .rule_text General
.rule{id: "section-400-1"}
  .rule_id 400.1.
  .rule_text A zone is a place where objects can be during a game. There are normally seven zones: library, hand, battlefield, graveyard, stack, exile, and command. Some older cards also use the ante zone. Each player has their own library, hand, and graveyard. The other zones are shared by all players.
.rule{id: "section-400-2"}
  .rule_id 400.2.
  .rule_text Public zones are zones in which all players can see the cards’ faces, except for those cards that some rule or effect specifically allow to be face down. Graveyard, battlefield, stack, exile, ante, and command are public zones. Hidden zones are zones in which not all players can be expected to see the cards’ faces. Library and hand are hidden zones, even if all the cards in one such zone happen to be revealed.
.rule{id: "section-400-3"}
  .rule_id 400.3.
  .rule_text If an object would go to any library, graveyard, or hand other than its owner’s, it goes to its owner’s corresponding zone.
.rule{id: "section-400-4"}
  .rule_id 400.4.
  .rule_text Cards with certain card types can’t enter certain zones.
.rule{id: "section-400-4a"}
  .rule_id 400.4a
  .rule_text If an instant or sorcery card would enter the battlefield, it remains in its previous zone.
.rule{id: "section-400-4b"}
  .rule_id 400.4b
  .rule_text If a conspiracy, phenomenon, plane, scheme, or vanguard card would leave the command zone, it remains in the command zone.
.rule{id: "section-400-5"}
  .rule_id 400.5.
  .rule_text The order of objects in a library, in a graveyard, or on the stack can’t be changed except when effects or rules allow it. The same is true for objects arranged in face-down piles in other zones. Other objects in other zones can be arranged however their owners wish, although who controls those objects, whether they’re tapped or flipped, and what other objects are attached to them must remain clear to all players.
.rule{id: "section-400-6"}
  .rule_id 400.6.
  .rule_text If an object would move from one zone to another, determine what event is moving the object. If the object is moving to a public zone and its owner will be able to look at it in that zone, its owner looks at it to see if it has any abilities that would affect the move. If the object is moving to the battlefield, each other player who will be able to look at it in that zone does so. Then any appropriate replacement effects, whether they come from that object or from elsewhere, are applied to that event. If any effects or rules try to do two or more contradictory or mutually exclusive things to a particular object, that object’s controller—or its owner if it has no controller—chooses which effect to apply, and what that effect does. (Note that multiple instances of the same thing may be mutually exclusive; for example, two simultaneous “destroy” effects.) Then the event moves the object.
  .rule_text Example: Exquisite Archangel has an ability which reads “If you would lose the game, instead exile Exquisite Archangel and your life total becomes equal to your starting life total.” A spell deals 5 damage to a player with 5 life and 5 damage to an Exquisite Archangel under that player’s control. As state-based actions are performed, that player’s life total becomes equal to their starting life total, and that player chooses whether Exquisite Archangel moves to its owner’s graveyard or to exile.
.rule{id: "section-400-7"}
  .rule_id 400.7.
  .rule_text An object that moves from one zone to another becomes a new object with no memory of, or relation to, its previous existence. This rule has the following exceptions.
.rule{id: "section-400-7a"}
  .rule_id 400.7a

  .rule_text An ability of a permanent can reference information about the spell that became that permanent as it resolved, including what costs were paid to cast that spell or what mana was spent to pay those costs.
.rule{id: "section-400-7e"}
  .rule_id 400.7e
  .rule_text Abilities that trigger when an object moves from one zone to another (for example, “When Rancor is put into a graveyard from the battlefield”) can find the new object that it became in the zone it moved to when the ability triggered, if that zone is a public zone.
.rule{id: "section-400-7f"}
  .rule_id 400.7f
  .rule_text Abilities of Auras that trigger when the enchanted permanent leaves the battlefield can find the new object that Aura became in its owner’s graveyard if it was put into that graveyard at the same time the enchanted permanent left the battlefield. It can also find the new object that Aura became in its owner’s graveyard as a result of being put there as a state-based action for not being attached to a permanent. (See rule <a href="#section-704-5m">704.5m</a>.)
.rule{id: "section-400-7g"}
  .rule_id 400.7g
  .rule_text If an effect grants a nonland card an ability that allows it to be cast, that ability will continue to apply to the new object that card became after it moved to the stack as a result of being cast this way.
.rule{id: "section-400-7h"}
  .rule_id 400.7h
  .rule_text If an effect allows a nonland card to be cast, other parts of that effect can find the new object that card becomes after it moves to the stack as a result of being cast this way.
.rule{id: "section-400-7i"}
  .rule_id 400.7i
  .rule_text If an effect allows a land card to be played, other parts of that effect can find the new object that land card becomes after it moves to the battlefield as a result of being played this way.
.rule{id: "section-400-7j"}
  .rule_id 400.7j
  .rule_text If an effect causes an object to move to a public zone, other parts of that effect can find that object. If the cost of a spell or ability causes an object to move to a public zone, that spell or ability’s effects can find that object.
.rule{id: "section-400-7k"}
  .rule_id 400.7k
  .rule_text After resolving a madness triggered ability (see rule <a href="#section-702-35">702.35</a>), if the exiled card wasn’t cast and was moved to a public zone, effects referencing the discarded card can find that object.
.rule{id: "section-400-7m"}
  .rule_id 400.7m
  .rule_text Stickers on an object in a public zone are retained as it moves to another public zone (see rule <a href="#section-123-5">123.5</a>). Any effects from stickers continue to apply to the new object it becomes in that zone.
.rule{id: "section-400-8"}
  .rule_id 400.8.

.rule{id: "section-400-11b"}
  .rule_id 400.11b
  .rule_text Some effects bring cards into a game from outside the game. Those cards remain in the game until the game ends, their owner leaves the game, or a rule or effect removes them from the game, whichever comes first.
.rule{id: "section-400-11c"}
  .rule_id 400.11c
  .rule_text Cards outside the game can’t be affected by spells or abilities, except for characteristic-defining abilities printed on them (see rule <a href="#section-604-3">604.3</a>) and spells and abilities that allow those cards to be brought into the game.
.rule{id: "section-400-12"}
  .rule_id 400.12.
  .rule_text Some effects instruct a player to do something to a zone (such as “Shuffle your hand into your library”). That action is performed on all cards in that zone. The zone itself is not affected.

  .rule_id 401.
  .rule_text Library
.rule{id: "section-401-1"}
  .rule_id 401.1.
  .rule_text When a game begins, each player’s deck becomes their library.
.rule{id: "section-401-2"}
  .rule_id 401.2.
  .rule_text Each library must be kept in a single face-down pile. Players can’t look at or change the order of cards in a library.

  .rule_text Any player may count the number of cards remaining in any player’s library at any time.
.rule{id: "section-401-4"}
  .rule_id 401.4.
  .rule_text If an effect puts two or more cards in a specific position in a library at the same time, the owner of those cards may arrange them in any order. That library’s owner doesn’t reveal the order in which the cards go into the library.
.rule{id: "section-401-5"}
  .rule_id 401.5.
  .rule_text Some effects tell a player to play with the top card of their library revealed, or say that a player may look at the top card of their library. If the top card of the player’s library changes while a spell is being cast, the new top card won’t be revealed and can’t be looked at until the spell becomes cast (see rule <a href="#section-601-2i">601.2i</a>). The same is true with relation to an ability being activated.
.rule{id: "section-401-6"}
  .rule_id 401.6.
  .rule_text If an effect causes a player to play with the top card of their library revealed, and that particular card stops being revealed for any length of time before being revealed again, it becomes a new object.
.rule{id: "section-401-7"}
  .rule_id 401.7.
  .rule_text If an effect causes a player to put a card into a library “Nth from the top,” and that library has fewer than N cards in it, the player puts that card on the bottom of that library.
.rule{id: "section-402"}
  .rule_id 402.
  .rule_text Hand
.rule{id: "section-402-1"}
  .rule_id 402.1.
  .rule_text The hand is where a player holds cards that have been drawn. Cards can be put into a player’s hand by other effects as well. At the beginning of the game, each player draws a number of cards equal to that player’s starting hand size, normally seven. (See rule <a href="#section-103">103</a>, “Starting the Game.”)
.rule{id: "section-402-2"}
  .rule_id 402.2.
  .rule_text Each player has a maximum hand size, which is normally seven cards. A player may have any number of cards in their hand, but as part of their cleanup step, the player must discard excess cards down to the maximum hand size.
.rule{id: "section-402-3"}
  .rule_id 402.3.
  .rule_text A player may arrange their hand in any convenient fashion and look at it at any time. A player can’t look at the cards in another player’s hand but may count those cards at any time.
.rule{id: "section-403"}
  .rule_id 403.
  .rule_text Battlefield
.rule{id: "section-403-1"}
  .rule_id 403.1.
  .rule_text Most of the area between the players represents the battlefield. The battlefield starts out empty. Permanents a player controls are normally kept in front of them on the battlefield, though there are some cases (such as an Aura attached to another player’s permanent) when a permanent one player controls is kept closer to a different player.
.rule{id: "section-403-2"}
  .rule_id 403.2.
  .rule_text A spell or ability affects and checks only the battlefield unless it specifically mentions a player or another zone.
.rule{id: "section-403-3"}
  .rule_id 403.3.
  .rule_text Permanents exist only on the battlefield. Every object on the battlefield is a permanent. See rule <a href="#section-110">110</a>, “Permanents.”
.rule{id: "section-403-4"}
  .rule_id 403.4.
  .rule_text Whenever a permanent enters the battlefield, it becomes a new object and has no relationship to any previous permanent represented by the same card, except for the cases listed in rule <a href="#section-400-7">400.7</a>. (This is also true for any objects entering any zone.)
.rule{id: "section-403-5"}
  .rule_id 403.5.
  .rule_text Previously, the battlefield was called the “in-play zone.” Cards that were printed with text that contains the phrases “in play,” “from play,” “into play,” or the like are referring to the battlefield. Cards that were printed with that text have received errata in the Oracle card reference.
.rule{id: "section-404"}
  .rule_id 404.
  .rule_text Graveyard
.rule{id: "section-404-1"}
  .rule_id 404.1.
  .rule_text A player’s graveyard is their discard pile. Any object that’s countered, discarded, destroyed, or sacrificed is put on top of its owner’s graveyard, as is any instant or sorcery spell that’s finished resolving. Each player’s graveyard starts out empty.
.rule{id: "section-404-2"}
  .rule_id 404.2.
  .rule_text Each graveyard is kept in a single face-up pile. A player can examine the cards in any graveyard at any time but normally can’t change their order. Additional rules applying to sanctioned tournaments may allow a player to change the order of cards in their graveyard.
.rule{id: "section-404-3"}
  .rule_id 404.3.
  .rule_text If an effect or rule puts two or more cards into the same graveyard at the same time, the owner of those cards may arrange them in any order.
.rule{id: "section-405"}
  .rule_id 405.
  .rule_text Stack
.rule{id: "section-405-1"}
  .rule_id 405.1.
  .rule_text When a spell is cast, the physical card is put on the stack (see rule <a href="#section-601-2a">601.2a</a>). When an ability is activated or triggers, it goes on top of the stack without any card associated with it (see rules <a href="#section-602-2a">602.2a</a> and <a href="#section-603-3">603.3</a>).
.rule{id: "section-405-2"}
  .rule_id 405.2.
  .rule_text The stack keeps track of the order that spells and/or abilities were added to it. Each time an object is put on the stack, it’s put on top of all objects already there.
.rule{id: "section-405-3"}
  .rule_id 405.3.
  .rule_text If an effect puts two or more objects on the stack at the same time, those controlled by the active player are put on lowest, followed by each other player’s objects in APNAP order (see rule <a href="#section-101-4">101.4</a>). If a player controls more than one of these objects, that player chooses their relative order on the stack.
.rule{id: "section-405-4"}
  .rule_id 405.4.
  .rule_text Each spell has all the characteristics of the card associated with it. Each activated or triggered ability that’s on the stack has the text of the ability that created it and no other characteristics. The controller of a spell is the person who cast it. The controller of an activated ability is the player who activated it. The controller of a triggered ability is the player who controlled the ability’s source when it triggered, unless it’s a delayed triggered ability. To determine the controller of a delayed triggered ability, see rules <a href="#section-603-7d">603.7d</a>–f.
.rule{id: "section-405-5"}
  .rule_id 405.5.
  .rule_text When all players pass in succession, the top (last-added) spell or ability on the stack resolves. If the stack is empty when all players pass, the current step or phase ends and the next begins.
.rule{id: "section-405-6"}
  .rule_id 405.6.
  .rule_text Some things that happen during the game don’t use the stack.
.rule{id: "section-405-6a"}
  .rule_id 405.6a
  .rule_text Effects don’t go on the stack; they’re the result of spells and abilities resolving. Effects may create delayed triggered abilities, however, and these may go on the stack when they trigger (see rule <a href="#section-603-7">603.7</a>).
.rule{id: "section-405-6b"}
  .rule_id 405.6b
  .rule_text Static abilities continuously generate effects and don’t go on the stack. (See rule <a href="#section-604">604</a>, “Handling Static Abilities.”) This includes characteristic-defining abilities such as “[This object] is red” (see rule <a href="#section-604-3">604.3</a>).

  .rule_text Exile
.rule{id: "section-406-1"}
  .rule_id 406.1.
  .rule_text The exile zone is essentially a holding area for objects. Some spells and abilities exile an object without any way to return that object to another zone. Other spells and abilities exile an object only temporarily.
.rule{id: "section-406-2"}
  .rule_id 406.2.
  .rule_text To exile an object is to put it into the exile zone from whatever zone it’s currently in. An exiled card is a card that’s been put into the exile zone.
.rule{id: "section-406-3"}
  .rule_id 406.3.
  .rule_text Exiled cards are, by default, kept face up and may be examined by any player at any time. Cards “exiled face down” can’t be examined by any player except when instructions allow it. However, if a player is instructed to look at a card and then exile it face down, or once a player is allowed to look at a card exiled face down, that player may continue to look at that card as long as it remains exiled, even if the instruction allowing the player to do so no longer applies.
.rule{id: "section-406-3a"}
  .rule_id 406.3a
  .rule_text A card exiled face down has no characteristics, but the spell or ability that exiled it may allow it to be played from exile. Unless that card is being cast face down (see rule <a href="#section-708-4">708.4</a>), the card is turned face up just before the player announces that they are playing the card (see rule <a href="#section-601-2">601.2</a>).
.rule{id: "section-406-3b"}
  .rule_id 406.3b
  .rule_text Some spells and abilities allow a player to cast spells with certain qualities from among face-down cards in exile. A player may cast such a spell only if they are allowed to look at the face-down card in exile and if the resulting spell has the specified qualities.
.rule{id: "section-406-4"}
  .rule_id 406.4.
  .rule_text Face-down cards in exile should be kept in separate piles based on when they were exiled and how they were exiled. If a player is instructed to choose an exiled card, the player may choose a specific face-down card only if the player is allowed to look at that card. Otherwise, they may choose a pile of face-down exiled cards, and then a card is chosen at random from within that pile. If choosing such a card is part of casting a spell or activating an ability, the chosen card isn’t revealed until after that cost is fully paid. (See rule <a href="#section-601-2i">601.2i</a>.)
.rule{id: "section-406-5"}
  .rule_id 406.5.
  .rule_text Exiled cards that might return to the battlefield or any other zone should be kept in separate piles to keep track of their respective ways of returning. Exiled cards that may have an impact on the game due to their own abilities (such as cards with haunt) or the abilities of the cards that exiled them should likewise be kept in separate piles.
.rule{id: "section-406-6"}
  .rule_id 406.6.
  .rule_text An object may have one ability printed on it that causes one or more cards to be exiled, and another ability that refers either to “the exiled cards” or to cards “exiled with [this object].” These abilities are linked: the second refers only to cards that have been exiled due to the first. See rule <a href="#section-607">607</a>, “Linked Abilities.”

.rule{id: "section-406-8"}
  .rule_id 406.8.
  .rule_text Previously, the exile zone was called the “removed-from-the-game zone.” Cards that were printed with text that “removes [an object] from the game” exiles that object. The same is true for cards printed with text that “sets [an object] aside.” Cards that were printed with that text have received errata in the Oracle card reference.

  .rule_text Ante
.rule{id: "section-407-1"}
  .rule_id 407.1.
  .rule_text Earlier versions of the Magic rules included an ante rule as a way of playing “for keeps.” Playing Magic games for ante is now considered an optional variation on the game, and it’s allowed only where it’s not forbidden by law or by other rules. Playing for ante is strictly forbidden under the Magic: The Gathering Tournament Rules (WPN.Wizards.com/en/resources/rules-documents).
.rule{id: "section-407-2"}
  .rule_id 407.2.
  .rule_text When playing for ante, each player puts one random card from their deck into the ante zone after determining which player goes first but before players draw any cards. Cards in the ante zone may be examined by any player at any time. At the end of the game, the winner becomes the owner of all the cards in the ante zone.
.rule{id: "section-407-3"}
  .rule_id 407.3.
  .rule_text A few cards have the text “Remove [this card] from your deck before playing if you’re not playing for ante.” These are the only cards that can add or remove cards from the ante zone or change a card’s owner. When not playing for ante, players can’t include these cards in their decks or sideboards, and these cards can’t be brought into the game from outside the game.
.rule{id: "section-407-4"}
  .rule_id 407.4.
  .rule_text To ante an object is to put that object into the ante zone from whichever zone it’s currently in. The owner of an object is the only person who can ante that object.

  .rule_id 500.
  .rule_text General
.rule{id: "section-500-1"}
  .rule_id 500.1.
  .rule_text A turn consists of five phases, in this order: beginning, precombat main, combat, postcombat main, and ending. Each of these phases takes place every turn, even if nothing happens during the phase. The beginning, combat, and ending phases are further broken down into steps, which proceed in order.
.rule{id: "section-500-2"}
  .rule_id 500.2.
  .rule_text A phase or step in which players receive priority ends when the stack is empty and all players pass in succession. Simply having the stack become empty doesn’t cause such a phase or step to end; all players have to pass in succession with the stack empty. Because of this, each player gets a chance to add new things to the stack before that phase or step ends.
.rule{id: "section-500-3"}
  .rule_id 500.3.
  .rule_text A step in which no players receive priority ends when all specified actions that take place during that step are completed. The only such steps are the untap step (see rule <a href="#section-502">502</a>) and certain cleanup steps (see rule <a href="#section-514">514</a>).
.rule{id: "section-500-4"}
  .rule_id 500.4.
  .rule_text When a step or phase ends, any unused mana left in a player’s mana pool empties. This turn-based action doesn’t use the stack.
.rule{id: "section-500-5"}
  .rule_id 500.5.
  .rule_text When a phase or step ends, any effects scheduled to last “until end of” that phase or step expire. When a phase or step begins, any effects scheduled to last “until” that phase or step expire. Effects that last “until end of combat” expire at the end of the combat phase, not at the beginning of the end of combat step. Effects that last “until end of turn” are subject to special rules; see rule <a href="#section-514-2">514.2</a>.
.rule{id: "section-500-6"}
  .rule_id 500.6.
  .rule_text When a phase or step begins, any abilities that trigger “at the beginning of” that phase or step trigger. They are put on the stack the next time a player would receive priority. (See rule <a href="#section-117">117</a>, “Timing and Priority.”)
.rule{id: "section-500-7"}
  .rule_id 500.7.
  .rule_text Some effects can give a player extra turns. They do this by adding the turns directly after the specified turn. If a player is given multiple extra turns, the extra turns are added one at a time. If multiple players are given extra turns, the extra turns are added one at a time, in APNAP order (see rule <a href="#section-101-4">101.4</a>). The most recently created turn will be taken first.
.rule{id: "section-500-8"}
  .rule_id 500.8.
  .rule_text Some effects can add phases to a turn. They do this by adding the phases directly after the specified phase. If multiple extra phases are created after the same phase, the most recently created phase will occur first.
.rule{id: "section-500-9"}
  .rule_id 500.9.
  .rule_text Some effects can add steps to a phase. They do this by adding the steps directly after a specified step or directly before a specified step. If multiple extra steps are created after the same step, the most recently created step will occur first.
.rule{id: "section-500-10"}
  .rule_id 500.10.
  .rule_text Some effects can cause a step, phase, or turn to be skipped. To skip a step, phase, or turn is to proceed past it as though it didn’t exist. See rule <a href="#section-614-10">614.10</a>.
.rule{id: "section-500-11"}

  .rule_text Beginning Phase
.rule{id: "section-501-1"}
  .rule_id 501.1.

  .rule_id 502.
  .rule_text Untap Step
.rule{id: "section-502-1"}
  .rule_id 502.1.
  .rule_text First, all phased-in permanents with phasing that the active player controls phase out, and all phased-out permanents that the active player controlled when they phased out phase in. This all happens simultaneously. This turn-based action doesn’t use the stack. See rule <a href="#section-702-26">702.26</a>, “Phasing.”
.rule{id: "section-502-2"}
  .rule_id 502.2.
  .rule_text Second, if it’s day and the previous turn’s active player didn’t cast any spells during that turn, it becomes night. If it’s night and the previous turn’s active player cast two or more spells during that turn, it becomes day. If it’s neither day nor night, this check doesn’t happen and it remains neither. This turn-based action doesn’t use the stack. See rule <a href="#section-726">726</a>, “Day and Night.”
.rule{id: "section-502-2a"}
  .rule_id 502.2a
  .rule_text Multiplayer games using the shared team turns option use a modified rule. If it’s day and no player on the previous turn’s active team cast a spell during that turn, it becomes night. If it’s night and any player on the previous turn’s active team cast two or more spells during the previous turn, it becomes day. If it’s neither day nor night, this check doesn’t happen and it remains neither. This turn-based action doesn’t use the stack.
.rule{id: "section-502-3"}
  .rule_id 502.3.
  .rule_text Third, the active player determines which permanents they control will untap. Then they untap them all simultaneously. This turn-based action doesn’t use the stack. Normally, all of a player’s permanents untap, but effects can keep one or more of a player’s permanents from untapping.
.rule{id: "section-502-4"}
  .rule_id 502.4.
  .rule_text No player receives priority during the untap step, so no spells can be cast or resolve and no abilities can be activated or resolve. Any ability that triggers during this step will be held until the next time a player would receive priority, which is usually during the upkeep step. (See rule <a href="#section-503">503</a>, “Upkeep Step.”)
.rule{id: "section-503"}
  .rule_id 503.
  .rule_text Upkeep Step
.rule{id: "section-503-1"}
  .rule_id 503.1.
  .rule_text The upkeep step has no turn-based actions. Once it begins, the active player gets priority. (See rule <a href="#section-117">117</a>, “Timing and Priority.”)
.rule{id: "section-503-1a"}
  .rule_id 503.1a
  .rule_text Any abilities that triggered during the untap step and any abilities that triggered at the beginning of the upkeep are put onto the stack before the active player gets priority; the order in which they triggered doesn’t matter. (See rule <a href="#section-603">603</a>, “Handling Triggered Abilities.”)
.rule{id: "section-503-2"}
  .rule_id 503.2.
  .rule_text If a spell states that it may be cast only “after [a player’s] upkeep step,” and the turn has multiple upkeep steps, that spell may be cast any time after the first upkeep step ends.

  .rule_id 504.
  .rule_text Draw Step
.rule{id: "section-504-1"}
  .rule_id 504.1.

  .rule_text Second, the active player gets priority. (See rule <a href="#section-117">117</a>, “Timing and Priority.”)
  .rule_text  
  .rule_text <a href="#section-505">505</a>. Main Phase
.rule{id: "section-505-1"}
  .rule_id 505.1.
  .rule_text There are two main phases in a turn. In each turn, the first main phase (also known as the precombat main phase) and the second main phase (also known as the postcombat main phase) are separated by the combat phase (see rule <a href="#section-506">506</a>, “Combat Phase”). The precombat and postcombat main phases are individually and collectively known as the main phase.
.rule{id: "section-505-1a"}
  .rule_id 505.1a
  .rule_text Only the first main phase of the turn is a precombat main phase. All other main phases are postcombat main phases. This includes the second main phase of a turn in which the combat phase has been skipped. It is also true of a turn in which an effect has caused an additional combat phase and an additional main phase to be created.
.rule{id: "section-505-2"}
  .rule_id 505.2.
  .rule_text The main phase has no steps, so a main phase ends when all players pass in succession while the stack is empty. (See rule <a href="#section-500-2">500.2</a>.)
.rule{id: "section-505-3"}
  .rule_id 505.3.
  .rule_text First, but only if the players are playing an Archenemy game (see rule <a href="#section-904">904</a>), the active player is the archenemy, and it’s the active player’s precombat main phase, the active player sets the top card of their scheme deck in motion (see rule <a href="#section-701-25">701.25</a>). This turn-based action doesn’t use the stack.
.rule{id: "section-505-4"}
  .rule_id 505.4.
  .rule_text Second, if the active player controls one or more Saga enchantments and it’s the active player’s precombat main phase, the active player puts a lore counter on each Saga they control. (See rule <a href="#section-714">714</a>, “Saga Cards.”) This turn-based action doesn’t use the stack.
.rule{id: "section-505-5"}
  .rule_id 505.5.
  .rule_text Third, if the active player controls one or more Attractions and it’s the active player’s precombat main phase, the active player rolls to visit their Attractions. (See rule <a href="#section-701-49">701.49</a>, “Roll to Visit Your Attractions.”) This turn-based action doesn’t use the stack.
.rule{id: "section-505-6"}
  .rule_id 505.6.
  .rule_text Fourth, the active player gets priority. (See rule <a href="#section-117">117</a>, “Timing and Priority.”)
.rule{id: "section-505-6a"}
  .rule_id 505.6a
  .rule_text The main phase is the only phase in which a player can normally cast artifact, creature, enchantment, planeswalker, and sorcery spells. The active player may cast these spells.
.rule{id: "section-505-6b"}
  .rule_id 505.6b
  .rule_text During either main phase, the active player may play one land card from their hand if the stack is empty, if the player has priority, and if they haven’t played a land this turn (unless an effect states the player may play additional lands). This action doesn’t use the stack. Neither the land nor the action of playing the land is a spell or ability, so it can’t be countered, and players can’t respond to it with instants or activated abilities. (See rule <a href="#section-305">305</a>, “Lands.”)
.rule{id: "section-506"}
  .rule_id 506.
  .rule_text Combat Phase
.rule{id: "section-506-1"}
  .rule_id 506.1.
  .rule_text The combat phase has five steps, which proceed in order: beginning of combat, declare attackers, declare blockers, combat damage, and end of combat. The declare blockers and combat damage steps are skipped if no creatures are declared as attackers or put onto the battlefield attacking (see rule <a href="#section-508-8">508.8</a>). There are two combat damage steps if any attacking or blocking creature has first strike (see rule <a href="#section-702-7">702.7</a>) or double strike (see rule <a href="#section-702-4">702.4</a>).
.rule{id: "section-506-2"}
  .rule_id 506.2.
  .rule_text During the combat phase, the active player is the attacking player; creatures that player controls may attack. During the combat phase of a two-player game, the nonactive player is the defending player; that player, planeswalkers they control, and battles they protect may be attacked.
.rule{id: "section-506-2a"}
  .rule_id 506.2a
  .rule_text During the combat phase of a multiplayer game, there may be one or more defending players, depending on the variant being played and the options chosen for it. Unless all the attacking player’s opponents automatically become defending players during the combat phase, the attacking player chooses one of their opponents as a turn-based action during the beginning of combat step. (Note that the choice may be dictated by the variant being played or the options chosen for it.) That player becomes the defending player. See rule <a href="#section-802">802</a>, “Attack Multiple Players Option,” rule <a href="#section-803">803</a>, “Attack Left and Attack Right Options,” and rule <a href="#section-809">809</a>, “Emperor Variant.”

  .rule_text A spell that states it may be cast “only before (or after) attackers are declared” is referring to the turn-based action of declaring attackers. It may be cast only before (or after) the declare attackers step begins, regardless of whether any attackers are actually declared. (See rule <a href="#section-508">508</a>.)
.rule{id: "section-506-7b"}
  .rule_id 506.7b
  .rule_text A spell that states it may be cast “only before (or after) blockers are declared” is referring to the turn-based action of declaring blockers. It may be cast only before (or after) the declare blockers step begins, regardless of whether any blockers are actually declared. (See rule <a href="#section-509">509</a>.)
.rule{id: "section-506-7c"}
  .rule_id 506.7c
  .rule_text Some spells state that they may be cast only “during combat” or “during a certain player’s combat phase” in addition to the criteria described in rule <a href="#section-506-7">506.7</a>. If a turn has multiple combat phases, such spells may be cast at an appropriate time during any of them.
.rule{id: "section-506-7d"}
  .rule_id 506.7d
  .rule_text Some spells state that they may be cast “only before (or after) [a particular point in the combat phase],” but don’t meet the additional criteria described in rule <a href="#section-506-7c">506.7c</a>. If a turn has multiple combat phases, such spells may be cast that turn only before (or after) the stated point of the first combat phase.
.rule{id: "section-506-7e"}
  .rule_id 506.7e
  .rule_text If a spell states that it may be cast “only before [a particular point in the combat phase],” but the stated point doesn’t exist within the relevant combat phase because the declare blockers step and the combat damage step are skipped (see rule <a href="#section-508-8">508.8</a>), then the spell may be cast only before the declare attackers step ends. If the stated point doesn’t exist because the relevant combat phase has been skipped, then the spell may be cast only before the precombat main phase ends.
.rule{id: "section-506-7f"}
  .rule_id 506.7f
  .rule_text If a spell states that it may be cast “only during combat after blockers are declared,” but the declare blockers step is skipped that combat phase (see rule <a href="#section-508-8">508.8</a>), then the spell may not be cast during that combat phase.

  .rule_id 507.
  .rule_text Beginning of Combat Step
.rule{id: "section-507-1"}
  .rule_id 507.1.
  .rule_text First, if the game being played is a multiplayer game in which the active player’s opponents don’t all automatically become defending players, the active player chooses one of their opponents. That player becomes the defending player. This turn-based action doesn’t use the stack. (See rule <a href="#section-506-2">506.2</a>.)
.rule{id: "section-507-2"}
  .rule_id 507.2.

  .rule_id 508.
  .rule_text Declare Attackers Step
.rule{id: "section-508-1"}
  .rule_id 508.1.
  .rule_text First, the active player declares attackers. This turn-based action doesn’t use the stack. To declare attackers, the active player follows the steps below, in order. If at any point during the declaration of attackers, the active player is unable to comply with any of the steps listed below, the declaration is illegal; the game returns to the moment before the declaration (see rule <a href="#section-728">728</a>, “Handling Illegal Actions”).
.rule{id: "section-508-1a"}
  .rule_id 508.1a
  .rule_text The active player chooses which creatures that they control, if any, will attack. The chosen creatures must be untapped, they can’t also be battles, and each one must either have haste or have been controlled by the active player continuously since the turn began.
.rule{id: "section-508-1b"}
  .rule_id 508.1b
  .rule_text If the defending player controls any planeswalkers, is the protector of any battles, or the game allows the active player to attack multiple other players, the active player announces which player, planeswalker, or battle each of the chosen creatures is attacking.
.rule{id: "section-508-1c"}
  .rule_id 508.1c
  .rule_text The active player checks each creature they control to see whether it’s affected by any restrictions (effects that say a creature can’t attack, or that it can’t attack unless some condition is met). If any restrictions are being disobeyed, the declaration of attackers is illegal.
  .rule_text Example: A player controls two creatures, each with a restriction that states “[This creature] can’t attack alone.” It’s legal to declare both as attackers.
.rule{id: "section-508-1d"}
  .rule_id 508.1d
  .rule_text The active player checks each creature they control to see whether it’s affected by any requirements (effects that say a creature attacks if able, or that it attacks if some condition is met). If the number of requirements that are being obeyed is fewer than the maximum possible number of requirements that could be obeyed without disobeying any restrictions, the declaration of attackers is illegal. If a creature can’t attack unless a player pays a cost, that player is not required to pay that cost, even if attacking with that creature would increase the number of requirements being obeyed. If a requirement that says a creature attacks if able during a certain turn refers to a turn with multiple combat phases, the creature attacks if able during each declare attackers step in that turn.
  .rule_text Example: A player controls two creatures: one that “attacks if able” and one with no abilities. An effect states “No more than one creature can attack each turn.” The only legal attack is for just the creature that “attacks if able” to attack. It’s illegal to attack with the other creature, attack with both, or attack with neither.
.rule{id: "section-508-1e"}
  .rule_id 508.1e
  .rule_text If any of the chosen creatures have banding or a “bands with other” ability, the active player announces which creatures, if any, are banded with which. (See rule <a href="#section-702-22">702.22</a>, “Banding.”)
.rule{id: "section-508-1f"}
  .rule_id 508.1f
  .rule_text The active player taps the chosen creatures. Tapping a creature when it’s declared as an attacker isn’t a cost; attacking simply causes creatures to become tapped.
.rule{id: "section-508-1g"}
  .rule_id 508.1g
  .rule_text If there are any optional costs to attack with the chosen creatures (expressed as costs a player may pay “as” a creature attacks), the active player chooses which, if any, they will pay.
.rule{id: "section-508-1h"}
  .rule_id 508.1h
  .rule_text If any of the chosen creatures require paying costs to attack, or if any optional costs to attack were chosen, the active player determines the total cost to attack. Costs may include paying mana, tapping permanents, sacrificing permanents, discarding cards, and so on. Once the total cost is determined, it becomes “locked in.” If effects would change the total cost after this time, ignore this change.
.rule{id: "section-508-1i"}
  .rule_id 508.1i
  .rule_text If any of the costs require mana, the active player then has a chance to activate mana abilities (see rule <a href="#section-605">605</a>, “Mana Abilities”).
.rule{id: "section-508-1j"}
  .rule_id 508.1j
  .rule_text Once the player has enough mana in their mana pool, they pay all costs in any order. Partial payments are not allowed.
.rule{id: "section-508-1k"}
  .rule_id 508.1k
  .rule_text Each chosen creature still controlled by the active player becomes an attacking creature. It remains an attacking creature until it’s removed from combat or the combat phase ends, whichever comes first. See rule <a href="#section-506-4">506.4</a>.
.rule{id: "section-508-1m"}
  .rule_id 508.1m
  .rule_text Any abilities that trigger on attackers being declared trigger.
.rule{id: "section-508-2"}
  .rule_id 508.2.
  .rule_text Second, the active player gets priority. (See rule <a href="#section-117">117</a>, “Timing and Priority.”)
.rule{id: "section-508-2a"}
  .rule_id 508.2a
  .rule_text Abilities that trigger on a creature attacking trigger only at the point the creature is declared as an attacker. They will not trigger if a creature attacks and then that creature’s characteristics change to match the ability’s trigger condition.
  .rule_text Example: A permanent has the ability “Whenever a green creature attacks, destroy that creature at end of combat.” If a blue creature attacks and is later turned green, the ability will not trigger.
.rule{id: "section-508-2b"}
  .rule_id 508.2b
  .rule_text Any abilities that triggered on attackers being declared or that triggered during the process described in rules <a href="#section-508-1">508.1</a> are put onto the stack before the active player gets priority; the order in which they triggered doesn’t matter. (See rule <a href="#section-603">603</a>, “Handling Triggered Abilities.”)
.rule{id: "section-508-3"}
  .rule_id 508.3.
  .rule_text Triggered abilities that trigger on attackers being declared may have different trigger conditions.
.rule{id: "section-508-3a"}
  .rule_id 508.3a
  .rule_text An ability that reads “Whenever [a creature] attacks, . . .” triggers if that creature is declared as an attacker. Similarly, “Whenever [a creature] attacks [a player, planeswalker, or battle], . . .” triggers if that creature is declared as an attacker attacking that player or permanent. Such abilities won’t trigger if a creature is put onto the battlefield attacking.
.rule{id: "section-508-3b"}
  .rule_id 508.3b
  .rule_text An ability that reads “Whenever [a player, planeswalker, or battle] is attacked, . . .” triggers if one or more creatures are declared as attackers attacking that player or permanent. It won’t trigger if a creature is put onto the battlefield attacking that player or permanent.
.rule{id: "section-508-3c"}
  .rule_id 508.3c
  .rule_text An ability that reads “Whenever [a player] attacks with [a creature], . . .” triggers if a creature that player controls is declared as an attacker.
.rule{id: "section-508-3d"}
  .rule_id 508.3d
  .rule_text An ability that reads “Whenever [a player] attacks, . . .” triggers if one or more creatures that player controls are declared as attackers.
.rule{id: "section-508-3e"}
  .rule_id 508.3e
  .rule_text An ability that reads “Whenever [a player] attacks [another player], . . .” triggers if one or more creatures the first player controls are declared as attackers attacking the second player. It won’t trigger if a creature is put onto the battlefield attacking or if a creature attacks a planeswalker or a battle.
.rule{id: "section-508-3f"}
  .rule_id 508.3f
  .rule_text An ability that reads “Whenever [a creature] attacks and isn’t blocked, . . .” triggers during the declare blockers step, not the declare attackers step. See rule <a href="#section-509-5g">509.5g</a>.
.rule{id: "section-508-4"}
  .rule_id 508.4.
  .rule_text If a creature is put onto the battlefield attacking, its controller chooses which defending player, planeswalker a defending player controls, or battle a defending player protects it’s attacking as it enters the battlefield (unless the effect that put it onto the battlefield specifies what it’s attacking). Similarly, if an effect states that a creature is attacking, its controller chooses which defending player, planeswalker a defending player controls, or battle a defending player protects it’s attacking (unless the effect has already specified). Such creatures are “attacking” but, for the purposes of trigger events and effects, they never “attacked.”
.rule{id: "section-508-4a"}
  .rule_id 508.4a
  .rule_text If the effect that puts a creature onto the battlefield attacking specifies it’s attacking a certain player, and that player is no longer in the game when the effect resolves, the creature is put onto the battlefield but is never considered an attacking creature. The same is true if the effect specifies a creature is put onto the battlefield attacking a planeswalker or battle and that permanent is no longer on the battlefield or is no longer a planeswalker or battle when the effect resolves.
.rule{id: "section-508-4b"}
  .rule_id 508.4b
  .rule_text If the effect that states a creature is attacking specifies it’s attacking a certain player, and that player is no longer in the game when the effect resolves, the creature doesn’t become an attacking creature. The same is true if the effect specifies a creature is attacking a planeswalker or battle and that permanent is no longer on the battlefield or is no longer a planeswalker or battle when the effect resolves.
.rule{id: "section-508-4c"}
  .rule_id 508.4c
  .rule_text A creature that’s put onto the battlefield attacking or that is stated to be attacking isn’t affected by requirements or restrictions that apply to the declaration of attackers.
.rule{id: "section-508-5"}
  .rule_id 508.5.
  .rule_text If an ability of an attacking creature refers to a defending player, or a spell or ability refers to both an attacking creature and a defending player, then unless otherwise specified, the defending player it’s referring to is the player that creature is attacking, the controller of the planeswalker that creature is attacking, or the protector of the battle that creature is attacking. If that creature is no longer attacking, the defending player it’s referring to is the player that creature was attacking before it was removed from combat, the controller of the planeswalker that creature was attacking before it was removed from combat, or the protector of the battle that creature was attacking before it was removed from combat.
.rule{id: "section-508-5a"}
  .rule_id 508.5a
  .rule_text In a multiplayer game, any rule, object, or effect that refers to a “defending player” refers to one specific defending player, not to all of the defending players. If a spell or ability could apply to multiple attacking creatures, the appropriate defending player is individually determined for each of those attacking creatures. If there are multiple defending players that could be chosen, the controller of the spell or ability chooses one.
.rule{id: "section-508-6"}
  .rule_id 508.6.
  .rule_text A player is “attacking [a player]” if the first player controls a creature that is attacking the second player. A player has “attacked [a player]” if the first player declared one or more creatures as attackers attacking the second player.
.rule{id: "section-508-7"}
  .rule_id 508.7.
  .rule_text Some cards allow a player to reselect which player, planeswalker, or battle a creature is attacking.
.rule{id: "section-508-7a"}
  .rule_id 508.7a
  .rule_text The attacking creature isn’t removed from combat and it isn’t considered to have attacked a second time. That creature is attacking the reselected player or permanent, but it’s still considered to have attacked the player or permanent chosen as it was declared as an attacker.
.rule{id: "section-508-7b"}
  .rule_id 508.7b
  .rule_text While reselecting which player, planeswalker, or battle a creature is attacking, that creature isn’t affected by requirements or restrictions that apply to the declaration of attackers.
.rule{id: "section-508-7c"}
  .rule_id 508.7c
  .rule_text The reselected player, planeswalker, or battle must be an opponent of the attacking creature’s controller, a planeswalker controlled by an opponent of the attacking creature’s controller, or a battle protected by an opponent of the attacking creature’s controller.
.rule{id: "section-508-7d"}
  .rule_id 508.7d
  .rule_text In a multiplayer game not using the attack multiple players option (see rule <a href="#section-802">802</a>), the reselected player, planeswalker, or battle must be the chosen defending player, a planeswalker controlled by that player, or a battle protected by that player.
.rule{id: "section-508-7e"}
  .rule_id 508.7e
  .rule_text In a multiplayer game using the limited range of influence option (see rule <a href="#section-801">801</a>), the reselected player, planeswalker, or battle must be within the range of influence of the attacking creature’s controller. In the case of a battle, the battle’s protector must also be within the range of influence of the attacking creature’s controller.
.rule{id: "section-508-8"}
  .rule_id 508.8.
  .rule_text If no creatures are declared as attackers or put onto the battlefield attacking, skip the declare blockers and combat damage steps.

  .rule_text Declare Blockers Step
.rule{id: "section-509-1"}
  .rule_id 509.1.
  .rule_text First, the defending player declares blockers. This turn-based action doesn’t use the stack. To declare blockers, the defending player follows the steps below, in order. If at any point during the declaration of blockers, the defending player is unable to comply with any of the steps listed below, the declaration is illegal; the game returns to the moment before the declaration (see rule <a href="#section-728">728</a>, “Handling Illegal Actions”).
.rule{id: "section-509-1a"}
  .rule_id 509.1a
  .rule_text The defending player chooses which creatures they control, if any, will block. The chosen creatures must be untapped and they can’t also be battles. For each of the chosen creatures, the defending player chooses one creature for it to block that’s attacking that player, a planeswalker they control, or a battle they protect.
.rule{id: "section-509-1b"}
  .rule_id 509.1b
  .rule_text The defending player checks each creature they control to see whether it’s affected by any restrictions (effects that say a creature can’t block, or that it can’t block unless some condition is met). If any restrictions are being disobeyed, the declaration of blockers is illegal.
  .rule_text      A restriction may be created by an evasion ability (a static ability an attacking creature has that restricts what can block it). If an attacking creature gains or loses an evasion ability after a legal block has been declared, it doesn’t affect that block. Different evasion abilities are cumulative.
  .rule_text Example: An attacking creature with flying and shadow can’t be blocked by a creature with flying but without shadow.
.rule{id: "section-509-1c"}
  .rule_id 509.1c
  .rule_text The defending player checks each creature they control to see whether it’s affected by any requirements (effects that say a creature must block, or that it must block if some condition is met). If the number of requirements that are being obeyed is fewer than the maximum possible number of requirements that could be obeyed without disobeying any restrictions, the declaration of blockers is illegal. If a creature can’t block unless a player pays a cost, that player is not required to pay that cost, even if blocking with that creature would increase the number of requirements being obeyed. If a requirement that says a creature blocks if able during a certain turn refers to a turn with multiple combat phases, the creature blocks if able during each declare blockers step in that turn.
  .rule_text Example: A player controls one creature that “blocks if able” and another creature with no abilities. If a creature with menace attacks that player, the player must block with both creatures. Having only the first creature block violates the restriction created by menace (the attacking creature can’t be blocked except by two or more creatures). Having only the second creature block violates both the menace restriction and the first creature’s blocking requirement. Having neither creature block fulfills the restriction but not the requirement.
.rule{id: "section-509-1d"}
  .rule_id 509.1d
  .rule_text If any of the chosen creatures require paying costs to block, the defending player determines the total cost to block. Costs may include paying mana, tapping permanents, sacrificing permanents, discarding cards, and so on. Once the total cost is determined, it becomes “locked in.” If effects would change the total cost after this time, ignore this change.
.rule{id: "section-509-1e"}

.rule{id: "section-509-1g"}
  .rule_id 509.1g
  .rule_text Each chosen creature still controlled by the defending player becomes a blocking creature. Each one is blocking the attacking creatures chosen for it. It remains a blocking creature until it’s removed from combat or the combat phase ends, whichever comes first. See rule <a href="#section-506-4">506.4</a>.
.rule{id: "section-509-1h"}
  .rule_id 509.1h
  .rule_text An attacking creature with one or more creatures declared as blockers for it becomes a blocked creature; one with no creatures declared as blockers for it becomes an unblocked creature. This remains unchanged until the creature is removed from combat, an effect says that it becomes blocked or unblocked, or the combat phase ends, whichever comes first. A creature remains blocked even if all the creatures blocking it are removed from combat.
.rule{id: "section-509-1i"}

.rule{id: "section-509-2"}
  .rule_id 509.2.
  .rule_text Second, for each attacking creature that’s become blocked, the active player announces that creature’s damage assignment order, which consists of the creatures blocking it in an order of that player’s choice. (During the combat damage step, an attacking creature can’t assign combat damage to a creature that’s blocking it unless each creature ahead of that blocking creature in its order is assigned lethal damage.) This turn-based action doesn’t use the stack.
  .rule_text Example: Vastwood Gorger is blocked by Llanowar Elves, Runeclaw Bear, and Serra Angel. Vastwood Gorger’s controller announces the Vastwood Gorger’s damage assignment order as Serra Angel, then Llanowar Elves, then Runeclaw Bear.
.rule{id: "section-509-2a"}
  .rule_id 509.2a
  .rule_text During the declare blockers step, if a blocking creature is removed from combat or a spell or ability causes it to stop blocking an attacking creature, the blocking creature is removed from all relevant damage assignment orders.

.rule{id: "section-509-3"}
  .rule_id 509.3.
  .rule_text Third, for each blocking creature, the defending player announces that creature’s damage assignment order, which consists of the creatures it’s blocking in an order of that player’s choice.

  .rule_text Triggered abilities that trigger on blockers being declared may have different trigger conditions.
.rule{id: "section-509-5a"}
  .rule_id 509.5a
  .rule_text An ability that reads “Whenever [a creature] blocks, . . .” generally triggers only once each combat for that creature, even if it blocks multiple creatures. It triggers if the creature is declared as a blocker. It will also trigger if that creature becomes a blocker as the result of an effect, but only if it wasn’t a blocking creature at that time. (See rule <a href="#section-509-1g">509.1g</a>.) It won’t trigger if the creature is put onto the battlefield blocking.
.rule{id: "section-509-5b"}
  .rule_id 509.5b
  .rule_text An ability that reads “Whenever [a creature] blocks a creature, . . .” triggers once for each attacking creature the creature with the ability blocks. It triggers if the creature is declared as a blocker. It will also trigger if an effect causes that creature to block an attacking creature, but only if it wasn’t already blocking that attacking creature at that time. It won’t trigger if the creature is put onto the battlefield blocking.
.rule{id: "section-509-5c"}
  .rule_id 509.5c
  .rule_text An ability that reads “Whenever [a creature] becomes blocked, . . .” generally triggers only once each combat for that creature, even if it’s blocked by multiple creatures. It will trigger if that creature becomes blocked by at least one creature declared as a blocker. It will also trigger if that creature becomes blocked by an effect or by a creature that’s put onto the battlefield as a blocker, but only if the attacking creature was an unblocked creature at that time. (See rule <a href="#section-509-1h">509.1h</a>.)
.rule{id: "section-509-5d"}
  .rule_id 509.5d
  .rule_text An ability that reads “Whenever [a creature] becomes blocked by a creature, . . .” triggers once for each creature that blocks the specified creature. It triggers if a creature is declared as a blocker for the attacking creature. It will also trigger if an effect causes a creature to block the attacking creature, but only if it wasn’t already blocking that attacking creature at that time. In addition, it will trigger if a creature is put onto the battlefield blocking that creature. It won’t trigger if the creature becomes blocked by an effect rather than a creature.
.rule{id: "section-509-5e"}
  .rule_id 509.5e
  .rule_text If an ability triggers when a creature blocks or becomes blocked by a particular number of creatures, the ability triggers if the creature blocks or is blocked by that many creatures when blockers are declared. Effects that add or remove blockers can also cause such abilities to trigger. This applies to abilities that trigger on a creature blocking or being blocked by at least a certain number of creatures as well.
.rule{id: "section-509-5f"}
  .rule_id 509.5f
  .rule_text If an ability triggers when a creature with certain characteristics blocks, it will trigger only if the creature has those characteristics at the point blockers are declared, or at the point an effect causes it to block. If an ability triggers when a creature with certain characteristics becomes blocked, it will trigger only if the creature has those characteristics at the point it becomes a blocked creature. If an ability triggers when a creature becomes blocked by a creature with certain characteristics, it will trigger only if the latter creature has those characteristics at the point it becomes a blocking creature. None of those abilities will trigger if the relevant creature’s characteristics change to match the ability’s trigger condition later on.
  .rule_text Example: A creature has the ability “Whenever this creature becomes blocked by a white creature, destroy that creature at end of combat.” If the creature becomes blocked by a black creature that is later turned white, the ability will not trigger.
.rule{id: "section-509-5g"}
  .rule_id 509.5g
  .rule_text An ability that reads “Whenever [a creature] attacks and isn’t blocked, . . .” triggers if no creatures are declared as blockers for that creature. It will trigger even if the creature was never declared as an attacker (for example, if it entered the battlefield attacking). It won’t trigger if the attacking creature is blocked and then all its blockers are removed from combat.
.rule{id: "section-509-6"}

  .rule_text If a spell or ability causes a creature on the battlefield to block an attacking creature, the active player announces the blocking creature’s placement in the attacking creature’s damage assignment order. The relative order among the remaining blocking creatures is unchanged. Then the defending player announces the attacking creature’s placement in the blocking creature’s damage assignment order. The relative order among the remaining attacking creatures is unchanged. This is done as part of the blocking effect.

  .rule_text If a creature is put onto the battlefield blocking, its controller chooses which attacking creature it’s blocking as it enters the battlefield (unless the effect that put it onto the battlefield specifies what it’s blocking), then the active player announces the new creature’s placement in the blocked creature’s damage assignment order. The relative order among the remaining blocking creatures is unchanged. A creature put onto the battlefield this way is “blocking” but, for the purposes of trigger events and effects, it never “blocked.”
  .rule_text Example: Giant Spider is blocked by Canyon Minotaur. The defending player casts Flash Foliage, which creates a Saproling creature token blocking the Giant Spider. Giant Spider’s controller announces the Giant Spider’s damage assignment order as the Saproling token, then Canyon Minotaur.

  .rule_text First, the active player announces how each attacking creature assigns its combat damage, then the defending player announces how each blocking creature assigns its combat damage.

.rule{id: "section-510-1a"}
  .rule_id 510.1a
  .rule_text Each attacking creature and each blocking creature assigns combat damage equal to its power. Creatures that would assign 0 or less damage this way don’t assign combat damage at all.

  .rule_id 510.1b
  .rule_text An unblocked creature assigns its combat damage to the player, planeswalker, or battle it’s attacking. If it isn’t currently attacking anything (if, for example, it was attacking a planeswalker that has left the battlefield), it assigns no combat damage.
.rule{id: "section-510-1c"}
  .rule_id 510.1c
  .rule_text A blocked creature assigns its combat damage to the creatures blocking it. If no creatures are currently blocking it (if, for example, they were destroyed or removed from combat), it assigns no combat damage. If exactly one creature is blocking it, it assigns all its combat damage to that creature. If two or more creatures are blocking it, it assigns its combat damage to those creatures according to the damage assignment order announced for it. This may allow the blocked creature to divide its combat damage. However, it can’t assign combat damage to a creature that’s blocking it unless, when combat damage assignments are complete, each creature that precedes that blocking creature in its order is assigned lethal damage. When checking for assigned lethal damage, take into account damage already marked on the creature and damage from other creatures that’s being assigned during the same combat damage step, but not any abilities or effects that might change the amount of damage that’s actually dealt. An amount of damage that’s greater than a creature’s lethal damage may be assigned to it.
  .rule_text Example: The damage assignment order of an attacking Vastwood Gorger (a 5/6 creature) is Pride Guardian (a 0/3 creature) then Llanowar Elves (a 1/1 creature). Vastwood Gorger can assign 3 damage to the Guardian and 2 damage to the Elves, 4 damage to the Guardian and 1 damage to the Elves, or 5 damage to the Guardian.
  .rule_text Example: The damage assignment order of an attacking Vastwood Gorger (a 5/6 creature) is Pride Guardian (a 0/3 creature) then Llanowar Elves (a 1/1 creature). During the declare blockers step, the defending player casts Giant Growth targeting Pride Guardian, which gives it +3/+3 until end of turn. Vastwood Gorger must assign its 5 damage to the Guardian.
  .rule_text Example: The damage assignment order of an attacking Vastwood Gorger (a 5/6 creature) is Pride Guardian (a 0/3 creature) then Llanowar Elves (a 1/1 creature). During the declare blockers step, the defending player casts Mending Hands targeting Pride Guardian, which prevents the next 4 damage that would be dealt to it. Vastwood Gorger can assign 3 damage to the Guardian and 2 damage to the Elves, 4 damage to the Guardian and 1 damage to the Elves, or 5 damage to the Guardian.
  .rule_text Example: The damage assignment order of an attacking Enormous Baloth (a 7/7 creature) is Trained Armodon (a 3/3 creature) that already has 2 damage marked on it, then Foriysian Brigade (a 2/4 creature that can block an additional creature), then Silverback Ape (a 5/5 creature). The damage assignment order of an attacking Durkwood Boars (a 4/4 creature) is the same Foriysian Brigade, then Goblin Piker (a 2/1 creature). Among other possibilities, the active player may have the Baloth assign 1 damage to the Armodon, 1 damage to the Brigade, and 5 damage to the Ape, and have the Boars assign 3 damage to the Brigade and 1 damage to the Piker.

  .rule_text Second, all combat damage that’s been assigned is dealt simultaneously. This turn-based action doesn’t use the stack. No player has the chance to cast spells or activate abilities between the time combat damage is assigned and the time it’s dealt.
  .rule_text Example: Squadron Hawk (a 1/1 creature with flying) and Goblin Piker (a 2/1 creature) are attacking. Mogg Fanatic (a 1/1 creature with the ability “Sacrifice Mogg Fanatic: Mogg Fanatic deals 1 damage to any target.”) blocks the Goblin Piker. The defending player sacrifices Mogg Fanatic during the declare blockers step to deal 1 damage to the Squadron Hawk. The Hawk is destroyed. The Piker deals and is dealt no combat damage this turn. If the defending player instead left Mogg Fanatic on the battlefield, the Fanatic and the Piker would have dealt lethal damage to one another, but the Squadron Hawk couldn’t have been dealt damage.

After that step, instead of proceeding to the end of combat step, the phase gets a second combat damage step. The only creatures that assign combat damage in that step are the remaining attackers and blockers that had neither first strike nor double strike as the first combat damage step began, as well as the remaining attackers and blockers that currently have double strike.

  .rule_id 601.2.
  .rule_text To cast a spell is to take it from where it is (usually the hand), put it on the stack, and pay its costs, so that it will eventually resolve and have its effect. Casting a spell includes proposal of the spell (rules <a href="#section-601-2a">601.2a</a>–d) and determination and payment of costs (rules <a href="#section-601-2f">601.2f</a>–h). To cast a spell, a player follows the steps listed below, in order. A player must be legally allowed to cast the spell to begin this process (see rule <a href="#section-601-3">601.3</a>). If a player is unable to comply with the requirements of a step listed below while performing that step, the casting of the spell is illegal; the game returns to the moment before the casting of that spell was proposed (see rule <a href="#section-728">728</a>, “Handling Illegal Actions”).
.rule{id: "section-601-2a"}
  .rule_id 601.2a
  .rule_text To propose the casting of a spell, a player first moves that card (or that copy of a card) from where it is to the stack. It becomes the topmost object on the stack. It has all the characteristics of the card (or the copy of a card) associated with it, and that player becomes its controller. Any continuous effects that modify the characteristics of the spell as you start casting it begin as it is put on the stack (see rule <a href="#section-611-2f">611.2f</a>). The spell remains on the stack until it resolves, it’s countered, or a rule or effect moves it elsewhere.
.rule{id: "section-601-2b"}
  .rule_id 601.2b
  .rule_text If the spell is modal, the player announces the mode choice (see rule <a href="#section-700-2">700.2</a>). If the player wishes to splice any cards onto the spell (see rule <a href="#section-702-47">702.47</a>), they reveal those cards in their hand. If the spell has alternative or additional costs that will be paid as it’s being cast such as buyback or kicker costs (see rules <a href="#section-118-8">118.8</a> and <a href="#section-118-9">118.9</a>), the player announces their intentions to pay any or all of those costs (see rule <a href="#section-601-2f">601.2f</a>). A player can’t apply two alternative methods of casting or two alternative costs to a single spell. If the spell has a variable cost that will be paid as it’s being cast (such as an <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-x"><span class="sr-only">{X}</span></span></span> in its mana cost; see rule <a href="#section-107-3">107.3</a>), the player announces the value of that variable. If the value of that variable is defined in the text of the spell by a choice that player would make later in the announcement or resolution of the spell, that player makes that choice at this time instead of that later time. If a cost that will be paid as the spell is being cast includes hybrid mana symbols, the player announces the nonhybrid equivalent cost they intend to pay. If a cost that will be paid as the spell is being cast includes Phyrexian mana symbols, the player announces whether they intend to pay 2 life or a corresponding colored mana cost for each of those symbols. Previously made choices (such as choosing to cast a spell with flashback from a graveyard or choosing to cast a creature with morph face down) may restrict the player’s options when making these choices.
.rule{id: "section-601-2c"}
  .rule_id 601.2c
  .rule_text The player announces their choice of an appropriate object or player for each target the spell requires. A spell may require some targets only if an alternative or additional cost (such as a kicker cost) or a particular mode was chosen for it; otherwise, the spell is cast as though it did not require those targets. Similarly, a spell may require alternative targets only if an alternative or additional cost was chosen for it. If the spell has a variable number of targets, the player announces how many targets they will choose before they announce those targets. In some cases, the number of targets will be defined by the spell’s text. Once the number of targets the spell has is determined, that number doesn’t change, even if the information used to determine the number of targets does. The same target can’t be chosen multiple times for any one instance of the word “target” on the spell. However, if the spell uses the word “target” in multiple places, the same object or player can be chosen once for each instance of the word “target” (as long as it fits the targeting criteria). If any effects say that an object or player must be chosen as a target, the player chooses targets so that they obey the maximum possible number of such effects without violating any rules or effects that say that an object or player can’t be chosen as a target. The chosen objects and/or players each become a target of that spell. (Any abilities that trigger when those objects and/or players become the target of a spell trigger at this point; they’ll wait to be put on the stack until the spell has finished being cast.)
  .rule_text Example: If a spell says “Tap two target creatures,” then the same creature can’t be chosen twice; the spell requires two different legal targets. A spell that says “Destroy target artifact and target land,” however, can target the same artifact land twice because it uses the word “target” in multiple places.
.rule{id: "section-601-2d"}
  .rule_id 601.2d

.rule{id: "section-601-2f"}
  .rule_id 601.2f
  .rule_text The player determines the total cost of the spell. Usually this is just the mana cost. Some spells have additional or alternative costs. Some effects may increase or reduce the cost to pay, or may provide other alternative costs. Costs may include paying mana, tapping permanents, sacrificing permanents, discarding cards, and so on. The total cost is the mana cost or alternative cost (as determined in rule <a href="#section-601-2b">601.2b</a>), plus all additional costs and cost increases, and minus all cost reductions. If multiple cost reductions apply, the player may apply them in any order. If the mana component of the total cost is reduced to nothing by cost reduction effects, it is considered to be <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-0"><span class="sr-only">{0}</span></span></span>. It can’t be reduced to less than <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-0"><span class="sr-only">{0}</span></span></span>. Once the total cost is determined, any effects that directly affect the total cost are applied. Then the resulting total cost becomes “locked in.” If effects would change the total cost after this time, they have no effect.
.rule{id: "section-601-2g"}
  .rule_id 601.2g
  .rule_text If the total cost includes a mana payment, the player then has a chance to activate mana abilities (see rule <a href="#section-605">605</a>, “Mana Abilities”). Mana abilities must be activated before costs are paid.
.rule{id: "section-601-2h"}
  .rule_id 601.2h
  .rule_text The player pays the total cost. First, they pay all costs that don’t involve random elements or moving objects from the library to a public zone, in any order. Then they pay all remaining costs in any order. Partial payments are not allowed. Unpayable costs can’t be paid.
  .rule_text Example: You cast Altar’s Reap, which costs <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-1"><span class="sr-only">{1}</span></span><span class="mana mana-cost mana-b"><span class="sr-only">{B}</span></span></span> and has an additional cost of sacrificing a creature. You sacrifice Thunderscape Familiar, whose effect makes your black spells cost <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-1"><span class="sr-only">{1}</span></span></span> less to cast. Because a spell’s total cost is “locked in” before payments are actually made, you pay <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-b"><span class="sr-only">{B}</span></span></span>, not <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-1"><span class="sr-only">{1}</span></span><span class="mana mana-cost mana-b"><span class="sr-only">{B}</span></span></span>, even though you’re sacrificing the Familiar.

If any such choices could cause that effect to no longer prohibit that player from casting that spell, the player may begin to cast the spell, ignoring the effect.
  .rule_text Example: A player controls Void Winnower, which reads, in part, “Your opponents can’t cast spells with even mana values.” That player’s opponent may begin to cast Rolling Thunder, a card whose mana cost is <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-x"><span class="sr-only">{X}</span></span><span class="mana mana-cost mana-r"><span class="sr-only">{R}</span></span><span class="mana mana-cost mana-r"><span class="sr-only">{R}</span></span></span>, because the chosen value of X may cause the spell’s mana value to become odd.

If any such choices could cause that effect to apply, that player may begin to cast that spell as though it had flash.
  .rule_text Example: An effect says that you may cast Aura spells as though they had flash, and you have a creature card with bestow in your hand. Because choosing the bestow ability’s alternative cost causes that spell to become an Aura spell, you may legally begin to cast that spell as though it had flash.
.rule{id: "section-601-3c"}

  .rule_text Some rules and effects state that an alternative set of characteristics or a subset of characteristics are considered to determine if a card or copy of a card is legal to cast. These alternative characteristics replace the object’s characteristics for this determination. Continuous effects that would apply to that object once it has those characteristics are also considered.
  .rule_text Example: Garruk’s Horde says, in part, “You may cast creature spells from the top of your library.” If you control Garruk’s Horde and the top card of your library is a noncreature card with morph, you may cast it using its morph ability.
  .rule_text Example: Melek, Izzet Paragon says, in part, “You may cast instant and sorcery spells from the top of your library.” If you control Melek, Izzet Paragon and the top card of your library is Giant Killer, an adventurer creature card whose Adventure is an instant named Chop Down, you may cast Chop Down but not Giant Killer.

In that case, the spell’s controller may consider any other choices to be made in that step. If any such choices could allow them to choose a particular mode, alternative cost, or additional cost, they may do so.
  .rule_text Example: Inscription of Abundance is a modal spell with kicker and the text “Choose one. If this spell was kicked, choose any number instead.” When announcing the chosen modes for the spell, its controller may choose any number of modes, even though choosing to pay the kicker cost is normally done later in the announcement process.

It doesn’t matter if a rule or effect would make the casting of the spell illegal while determining and paying that spell’s costs (see rules <a href="#section-601-2f">601.2f</a>–h) or any time after the spell has been cast.

.rule{id: "section-602-1a"}
  .rule_id 602.1a
  .rule_text The activation cost is everything before the colon (:). An ability’s activation cost must be paid by the player who is activating it.
  .rule_text Example: The activation cost of an ability that reads “<span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-2"><span class="sr-only">{2}</span></span></span>, <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-t"><span class="sr-only">{T}</span></span></span>: You gain 1 life” is two mana of any type plus tapping the permanent that has the ability.
.rule{id: "section-602-1b"}
  .rule_id 602.1b
  .rule_text Some text after the colon of an activated ability states instructions that must be followed while activating that ability. Such text may state which players can activate that ability, may restrict when a player can activate the ability, or may define some aspect of the activation cost. This text is not part of the ability’s effect. It functions at all times. If an activated ability has any activation instructions, they appear last, after the ability’s effect.
.rule{id: "section-602-1c"}
  .rule_id 602.1c
  .rule_text An activated ability is the only kind of ability that can be activated. If an object or rule refers to activating an ability without specifying what kind, it must be referring to an activated ability.
.rule{id: "section-602-1d"}
  .rule_id 602.1d
  .rule_text Previously, the action of using an activated ability was referred to on cards as “playing” that ability. Cards that were printed with that text have received errata in the Oracle card reference so they now refer to “activating” that ability.
.rule{id: "section-602-2"}
  .rule_id 602.2.
  .rule_text To activate an ability is to put it onto the stack and pay its costs, so that it will eventually resolve and have its effect. Only an object’s controller (or its owner, if it doesn’t have a controller) can activate its activated ability unless the object specifically says otherwise. Activating an ability follows the steps listed below, in order. If, at any point during the activation of an ability, a player is unable to comply with any of those steps, the activation is illegal; the game returns to the moment before that ability started to be activated (see rule <a href="#section-728">728</a>, “Handling Illegal Actions”). Announcements and payments can’t be altered after they’ve been made.
.rule{id: "section-602-2a"}
  .rule_id 602.2a
  .rule_text The player announces that they are activating the ability. If an activated ability is being activated from a hidden zone, the card that has that ability is revealed. That ability is created on the stack as an object that’s not a card. It becomes the topmost object on the stack. It has the text of the ability that created it, and no other characteristics. Its controller is the player who activated the ability. The ability remains on the stack until it’s countered, it resolves, or an effect moves it elsewhere.
.rule{id: "section-602-2b"}

  .rule_text The remainder of the process for activating an ability is identical to the process for casting a spell listed in rules <a href="#section-601-2b">601.2b</a>–i. Those rules apply to activating an ability just as they apply to casting a spell. An activated ability’s analog to a spell’s mana cost (as referenced in rule <a href="#section-601-2f">601.2f</a>) is its activation cost.

.rule{id: "section-603-1a"}
  .rule_id 603.1a
  .rule_text A triggered ability may include instructions after its effects that limit what the ability may target or state that it can’t be countered. This text is not part of the ability’s effect. It functions while the ability is on the stack.
.rule{id: "section-603-2"}
  .rule_id 603.2.
  .rule_text Whenever a game event or game state matches a triggered ability’s trigger event, that ability automatically triggers. The ability doesn’t do anything at this point.
.rule{id: "section-603-2a"}
  .rule_id 603.2a
  .rule_text Because they aren’t cast or activated, triggered abilities can trigger even when it isn’t legal to cast spells and activate abilities. Effects that preclude abilities from being activated don’t affect them.

.rule{id: "section-603-2c"}
  .rule_id 603.2c
  .rule_text An ability triggers only once each time its trigger event occurs. However, it can trigger repeatedly if one event contains multiple occurrences.
  .rule_text Example: A permanent has an ability whose trigger condition reads, “Whenever a land is put into a graveyard from the battlefield, . . . .” If someone casts a spell that destroys all lands, the ability will trigger once for each land put into the graveyard during the spell’s resolution.
.rule{id: "section-603-2d"}
  .rule_id 603.2d
  .rule_text An ability may state that a triggered ability triggers additional times. In this case, rather than simply determining that such an ability has triggered, determine how many times it should trigger, then that ability triggers that many times. An effect that states that an ability triggers additional times doesn’t invoke itself repeatedly and doesn’t apply to other effects that affect how many times an ability triggers.
.rule{id: "section-603-2e"}
  .rule_id 603.2e
  .rule_text Some effects refer to a triggered ability of an object. Such effects refer only to triggered abilities the object has, not any delayed triggered abilities (see rule <a href="#section-603-7">603.7</a>) that may be created by abilities the object has.
.rule{id: "section-603-2f"}
  .rule_id 603.2f
  .rule_text Some trigger events use the word “becomes” (for example, “becomes attached” or “becomes blocked”). These trigger only at the time the named event happens—they don’t trigger if that state already exists or retrigger if it persists. An ability that triggers when a permanent “becomes tapped” or “becomes untapped” doesn’t trigger if the permanent enters the battlefield in that state.
  .rule_text Example: An ability that triggers when a permanent “becomes tapped” triggers only when the status of a permanent that’s already on the battlefield changes from untapped to tapped.
.rule{id: "section-603-2g"}
  .rule_id 603.2g
  .rule_text If a triggered ability’s trigger condition is met, but the object with that triggered ability is at no time visible to all players, the ability does not trigger.
.rule{id: "section-603-2h"}
  .rule_id 603.2h
  .rule_text An ability triggers only if its trigger event actually occurs. An event that’s prevented or replaced won’t trigger anything.
  .rule_text Example: An ability that triggers on damage being dealt won’t trigger if all the damage is prevented.
.rule{id: "section-603-2i"}
  .rule_id 603.2i
  .rule_text A triggered ability may have an instruction followed by “Do this only once each turn.” This ability triggers only if its source’s controller has not yet taken the indicated action that turn.
.rule{id: "section-603-3"}
  .rule_id 603.3.
  .rule_text Once an ability has triggered, its controller puts it on the stack as an object that’s not a card the next time a player would receive priority. See rule <a href="#section-117">117</a>, “Timing and Priority.” The ability becomes the topmost object on the stack. It has the text of the ability that created it, and no other characteristics. It remains on the stack until it’s countered, it resolves, a rule causes it to be removed from the stack, or an effect moves it elsewhere.
.rule{id: "section-603-3a"}
  .rule_id 603.3a
  .rule_text A triggered ability is controlled by the player who controlled its source at the time it triggered, unless it’s a delayed triggered ability. To determine the controller of a delayed triggered ability, see rules <a href="#section-603-7d">603.7d</a>–f.
.rule{id: "section-603-3b"}
  .rule_id 603.3b
  .rule_text If multiple abilities have triggered since the last time a player received priority, the abilities are placed on the stack in a two-part process. First, each player, in APNAP order, puts each triggered ability they control with a trigger condition that isn’t another ability triggering on the stack in any order they choose. (See rule <a href="#section-101-4">101.4</a>.) Second, each player, in APNAP order, puts all remaining triggered abilities they control on the stack in any order they choose. Then the game once again checks for and performs state-based actions until none are performed, then abilities that triggered during this process go on the stack. This process repeats until no new state-based actions are performed and no abilities trigger. Then the appropriate player gets priority.
.rule{id: "section-603-3c"}
  .rule_id 603.3c
  .rule_text If a triggered ability is modal, its controller announces the mode choice when putting the ability on the stack. If one of the modes would be illegal (due to an inability to choose legal targets, for example), that mode can’t be chosen. If no mode is chosen, the ability is removed from the stack. (See rule <a href="#section-700-2">700.2</a>.)
.rule{id: "section-603-3d"}
  .rule_id 603.3d
  .rule_text The remainder of the process for putting a triggered ability on the stack is identical to the process for casting a spell listed in rules <a href="#section-601-2c">601.2c</a>–d. If a choice is required when the triggered ability goes on the stack but no legal choices can be made for it, or if a rule or a continuous effect otherwise makes the ability illegal, the ability is simply removed from the stack.
.rule{id: "section-603-4"}
  .rule_id 603.4.
  .rule_text A triggered ability may read “When/Whenever/At [trigger event], if [condition], [effect].” When the trigger event occurs, the ability checks whether the stated condition is true. The ability triggers only if it is; otherwise it does nothing. If the ability triggers, it checks the stated condition again as it resolves. If the condition isn’t true at that time, the ability is removed from the stack and does nothing. Note that this mirrors the check for legal targets. This rule is referred to as the “intervening ‘if’ clause” rule. (The word “if” has only its normal English meaning anywhere else in the text of a card; this rule only applies to an “if” that immediately follows a trigger condition.)
  .rule_text Example: Felidar Sovereign reads, “At the beginning of your upkeep, if you have 40 or more life, you win the game.” Its controller’s life total is checked as that player’s upkeep begins. If that player has 39 or less life, the ability doesn’t trigger at all. If that player has 40 or more life, the ability triggers and goes on the stack. As the ability resolves, that player’s life total is checked again. If that player has 39 or less life at this time, the ability is removed from the stack and has no effect. If that player has 40 or more life at this time, the ability resolves and that player wins the game.
.rule{id: "section-603-5"}
  .rule_id 603.5.
  .rule_text Some triggered abilities’ effects are optional (they contain “may,” as in “At the beginning of your upkeep, you may draw a card”). These abilities go on the stack when they trigger, regardless of whether their controller intends to exercise the ability’s option or not. The choice is made when the ability resolves. Likewise, triggered abilities that have an effect “unless” something is true or a player chooses to do something will go on the stack normally; the “unless” part of the ability is dealt with when the ability resolves.
.rule{id: "section-603-6"}
  .rule_id 603.6.
  .rule_text Trigger events that involve objects changing zones are called “zone-change triggers.” Many abilities with zone-change triggers attempt to do something to that object after it changes zones. During resolution, these abilities look for the object in the zone that it moved to. If the object is unable to be found in the zone it went to, the part of the ability attempting to do something to the object will fail to do anything. The ability could be unable to find the object because the object never entered the specified zone, because it left the zone before the ability resolved, or because it is in a zone that is hidden from a player, such as a library or an opponent’s hand. (This rule applies even if the object leaves the zone and returns again before the ability resolves.) The most common zone-change triggers are enters-the-battlefield triggers and leaves-the-battlefield triggers.
.rule{id: "section-603-6a"}
  .rule_id 603.6a
  .rule_text Enters-the-battlefield abilities trigger when a permanent enters the battlefield. These are written, “When [this object] enters the battlefield, . . . “ or “Whenever a [type] enters the battlefield, . . .” Each time an event puts one or more permanents onto the battlefield, all permanents on the battlefield (including the newcomers) are checked for any enters-the-battlefield triggers that match the event.
.rule{id: "section-603-6b"}
  .rule_id 603.6b
  .rule_text Continuous effects that modify characteristics of a permanent do so the moment the permanent is on the battlefield (and not before then). The permanent is never on the battlefield with its unmodified characteristics. Continuous effects don’t apply before the permanent is on the battlefield, however (see rule <a href="#section-603-6d">603.6d</a>).
  .rule_text Example: If an effect reads “All lands are creatures” and a land card is played, the effect makes the land card into a creature the moment it enters the battlefield, so it would trigger abilities that trigger when a creature enters the battlefield. Conversely, if an effect reads “All creatures lose all abilities” and a creature card with an enters-the-battlefield triggered ability enters the battlefield, that effect will cause it to lose its abilities the moment it enters the battlefield, so the enters-the-battlefield ability won’t trigger.
.rule{id: "section-603-6c"}
  .rule_id 603.6c
  .rule_text Leaves-the-battlefield abilities trigger when a permanent moves from the battlefield to another zone, or when a phased-in permanent leaves the game because its owner leaves the game. These are written as, but aren’t limited to, “When [this object] leaves the battlefield, . . .” or “Whenever [something] is put into a graveyard from the battlefield, . . . .” (See also rule <a href="#section-603-10">603.10</a>.) An ability that attempts to do something to the card that left the battlefield checks for it only in the first zone that it went to. An ability that triggers when a card is put into a certain zone “from anywhere” is never treated as a leaves-the-battlefield ability, even if an object is put into that zone from the battlefield.
.rule{id: "section-603-6d"}
  .rule_id 603.6d
  .rule_text Some permanents have text that reads “[This permanent] enters the battlefield with . . . ,” “As [this permanent] enters the battlefield . . . ,” “[This permanent] enters the battlefield as . . . ,” or “[This permanent] enters the battlefield tapped.” Such text is a static ability—not a triggered ability—whose effect occurs as part of the event that puts the permanent onto the battlefield.
.rule{id: "section-603-6e"}
  .rule_id 603.6e
  .rule_text Some Auras have triggered abilities that trigger on the enchanted permanent leaving the battlefield. These triggered abilities can find the new object that permanent card became in the zone it moved to; they can also find the new object the Aura card became in its owner’s graveyard after state-based actions have been checked. See rule <a href="#section-400-7">400.7</a>.
.rule{id: "section-603-7"}
  .rule_id 603.7.
  .rule_text An effect may create a delayed triggered ability that can do something at a later time. A delayed triggered ability will contain “when,” “whenever,” or “at,” although that word won’t usually begin the ability.
.rule{id: "section-603-7a"}
  .rule_id 603.7a
  .rule_text Delayed triggered abilities are created during the resolution of spells or abilities, as the result of a replacement effect being applied, or as a result of a static ability that allows a player to take an action. A delayed triggered ability won’t trigger until it has actually been created, even if its trigger event occurred just beforehand. Other events that happen earlier may make the trigger event impossible.
  .rule_text Example: Part of an effect reads “When this creature leaves the battlefield,” but the creature in question leaves the battlefield before the spell or ability creating the effect resolves. In this case, the delayed ability never triggers.
  .rule_text Example: If an effect reads “When this creature becomes untapped” and the named creature becomes untapped before the effect resolves, the ability waits for the next time that creature untaps.
.rule{id: "section-603-7b"}
  .rule_id 603.7b
  .rule_text A delayed triggered ability will trigger only once—the next time its trigger event occurs—unless it has a stated duration, such as “this turn.” If its trigger event occurs more than once simultaneously and the ability doesn’t have a stated duration, the controller of the delayed triggered ability chooses which event causes the ability to trigger.
.rule{id: "section-603-7c"}
  .rule_id 603.7c
  .rule_text A delayed triggered ability that refers to a particular object still affects it even if the object changes characteristics. However, if that object is no longer in the zone it’s expected to be in at the time the delayed triggered ability resolves, the ability won’t affect it. (Note that if that object left that zone and then returned, it’s a new object and thus won’t be affected. See rule <a href="#section-400-7">400.7</a>.)
  .rule_text Example: An ability that reads “Exile this creature at the beginning of the next end step” will exile the permanent even if it’s no longer a creature during the next end step. However, it won’t do anything if the permanent left the battlefield before then.
.rule{id: "section-603-7d"}
  .rule_id 603.7d
  .rule_text If a spell creates a delayed triggered ability, the source of that delayed triggered ability is that spell. The controller of that delayed triggered ability is the player who controlled that spell as it resolved.
.rule{id: "section-603-7e"}
  .rule_id 603.7e
  .rule_text If an activated or triggered ability creates a delayed triggered ability, the source of that delayed triggered ability is the same as the source of that other ability. The controller of that delayed triggered ability is the player who controlled that other ability as it resolved.
.rule{id: "section-603-7f"}
  .rule_id 603.7f
  .rule_text If a static ability generates a replacement effect which causes a delayed triggered ability to be created, the source of that delayed triggered ability is the object with that static ability. The controller of that delayed triggered ability is the same as the controller of that object at the time the replacement effect was applied.
.rule{id: "section-603-7g"}
  .rule_id 603.7g
  .rule_text If a static ability allows a player to take an action and creates a delayed triggered ability if that player does so, the source of that delayed triggered ability is the object with that static ability. The controller of that delayed triggered ability is the same as the controller of that object at the time the action was taken.
.rule{id: "section-603-8"}
  .rule_id 603.8.
  .rule_text Some triggered abilities trigger when a game state (such as a player controlling no permanents of a particular card type) is true, rather than triggering when an event occurs. These abilities trigger as soon as the game state matches the condition. They’ll go onto the stack at the next available opportunity. These are called state triggers. (Note that state triggers aren’t the same as state-based actions.) A state-triggered ability doesn’t trigger again until the ability has resolved, has been countered, or has otherwise left the stack. Then, if the object with the ability is still in the same zone and the game state still matches its trigger condition, the ability will trigger again.
  .rule_text Example: A permanent’s ability reads, “Whenever you have no cards in hand, draw a card.” If its controller plays the last card from their hand, the ability will trigger once and won’t trigger again until it has left the stack. If its controller casts a spell that reads “Discard your hand, then draw that many cards,” the ability will trigger during the spell’s resolution because the player’s hand was momentarily empty.
.rule{id: "section-603-9"}
  .rule_id 603.9.
  .rule_text Some triggered abilities trigger specifically when a player loses the game. These abilities trigger when a player loses or leaves the game, regardless of the reason, unless that player leaves the game as the result of a draw. See rule <a href="#section-104-3">104.3</a>.
.rule{id: "section-603-10"}
  .rule_id 603.10.
  .rule_text Normally, objects that exist immediately after an event are checked to see if the event matched any trigger conditions, and continuous effects that exist at that time are used to determine what the trigger conditions are and what the objects involved in the event look like. However, some triggered abilities are exceptions to this rule; the game “looks back in time” to determine if those abilities trigger, using the existence of those abilities and the appearance of objects immediately prior to the event. The list of exceptions is as follows:
.rule{id: "section-603-10a"}
  .rule_id 603.10a
  .rule_text Some zone-change triggers look back in time. These are leaves-the-battlefield abilities, abilities that trigger when a card leaves a graveyard, and abilities that trigger when an object that all players can see is put into a hand or library.
  .rule_text Example: Two creatures are on the battlefield along with an artifact that has the ability “Whenever a creature dies, you gain 1 life.” Someone casts a spell that destroys all artifacts, creatures, and enchantments. The artifact’s ability triggers twice, even though the artifact goes to its owner’s graveyard at the same time as the creatures.
.rule{id: "section-603-10b"}

.rule{id: "section-603-11"}
  .rule_id 603.11.
  .rule_text Some objects have a static ability that’s linked to one or more triggered abilities. (See rule <a href="#section-607">607</a>, “Linked Abilities.”) These objects combine the abilities into one paragraph, with the static ability first, followed by each triggered ability that’s linked to it. A very few objects have triggered abilities which are written with the trigger condition in the middle of the ability, rather than at the beginning.
  .rule_text Example: An ability that reads “Reveal the first card you draw each turn. Whenever you reveal a basic land card this way, draw a card” is a static ability linked to a triggered ability.
.rule{id: "section-603-12"}
  .rule_id 603.12.
  .rule_text A resolving spell or ability may allow or instruct a player to take an action and create a triggered ability that triggers “when [a player] [does or doesn’t]” take that action or “when [something happens] this way.” These reflexive triggered abilities follow the rules for delayed triggered abilities (see rule <a href="#section-603-7">603.7</a>), except that they’re checked immediately after being created and trigger based on whether the trigger event or events occurred earlier during the resolution of the spell or ability that created them.
  .rule_text Example: Heart-Piercer Manticore has an ability that reads “When Heart-Piercer Manticore enters the battlefield, you may sacrifice another creature. When you do, Heart-Piercer Manticore deals damage equal to that creature’s power to any target.” The reflexive triggered ability triggers only when you sacrifice another creature due to the original triggered ability, and not if you sacrifice a creature for any other reason.

  .rule_text Normally, if the trigger event or events occur multiple times during the resolution of the spell or ability that created it, the reflexive triggered ability will trigger once for each of those times. However, if a resolving spell or ability includes a choice to pay a cost “any number of times” and creates a triggered ability that triggers “when [a player] pays [that cost] one or more times,” paying that cost one or more times causes the reflexive triggered ability to trigger only once.

  .rule_text Handling Static Abilities
.rule{id: "section-604-1"}
  .rule_id 604.1.
  .rule_text Static abilities do something all the time rather than being activated or triggered. They are written as statements, and they’re simply true.
.rule{id: "section-604-2"}
  .rule_id 604.2.
  .rule_text Static abilities create continuous effects, some of which are prevention effects or replacement effects. These effects are active as long as the permanent with the ability remains on the battlefield and has the ability, or as long as the object with the ability remains in the appropriate zone, as described in rule <a href="#section-113-6">113.6</a>.
.rule{id: "section-604-3"}
  .rule_id 604.3.
  .rule_text Some static abilities are characteristic-defining abilities. A characteristic-defining ability conveys information about an object’s characteristics that would normally be found elsewhere on that object (such as in its mana cost, type line, or power/toughness box). Characteristic-defining abilities can add to or override information found elsewhere on that object. Characteristic-defining abilities function in all zones. They also function outside the game and before the game begins.
.rule{id: "section-604-3a"}
  .rule_id 604.3a
  .rule_text A static ability is a characteristic-defining ability if it meets the following criteria: (1) It defines an object’s colors, subtypes, power, or toughness; (2) it is printed on the card it affects, it was granted to the token it affects by the effect that created the token, or it was acquired by the object it affects as the result of a copy effect or text-changing effect; (3) it does not directly affect the characteristics of any other objects; (4) it is not an ability that an object grants to itself; and (5) it does not set the values of such characteristics only if certain conditions are met.
.rule{id: "section-604-4"}
  .rule_id 604.4.
  .rule_text Many Auras, Equipment, and Fortifications have static abilities that modify the object they’re attached to, but those abilities don’t target that object. If an Aura, Equipment, or Fortification is moved to a different object, the ability stops applying to the original object and starts modifying the new one.
.rule{id: "section-604-5"}
  .rule_id 604.5.
  .rule_text Some static abilities apply while a spell is on the stack. These are often abilities that refer to countering the spell. Also, abilities that say “As an additional cost to cast . . . ,” “You may pay [cost] rather than pay [this object]’s mana cost,” and “You may cast [this object] without paying its mana cost” work while a spell is on the stack.
.rule{id: "section-604-6"}
  .rule_id 604.6.
  .rule_text Some static abilities apply while a card is in any zone that you could cast or play it from (usually your hand). These are limited to those that read, “You may [cast/play] [this card] . . . ,” “You can’t [cast/play] [this card] . . . ,” and “[Cast/Play] [this card] only . . . .”
.rule{id: "section-604-7"}

  .rule_text Mana Abilities
.rule{id: "section-605-1"}
  .rule_id 605.1.
  .rule_text Some activated abilities and some triggered abilities are mana abilities, which are subject to special rules. Only abilities that meet either of the following two sets of criteria are mana abilities, regardless of what other effects they may generate or what timing restrictions (such as “Activate only as an instant”) they may have.
.rule{id: "section-605-1a"}
  .rule_id 605.1a
  .rule_text An activated ability is a mana ability if it meets all of the following criteria: it doesn’t require a target (see rule <a href="#section-115-6">115.6</a>), it could add mana to a player’s mana pool when it resolves, and it’s not a loyalty ability. (See rule <a href="#section-606">606</a>, “Loyalty Abilities.”)
.rule{id: "section-605-1b"}
  .rule_id 605.1b
  .rule_text A triggered ability is a mana ability if it meets all of the following criteria: it doesn’t require a target (see rule <a href="#section-115-6">115.6</a>), it triggers from the activation or resolution of an activated mana ability (see rule <a href="#section-605-1a">605.1a</a>) or from mana being added to a player’s mana pool, and it could add mana to a player’s mana pool when it resolves.
.rule{id: "section-605-2"}
  .rule_id 605.2.
  .rule_text A mana ability remains a mana ability even if the game state doesn’t allow it to produce mana.
  .rule_text Example: A permanent has an ability that reads “<span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-t"><span class="sr-only">{T}</span></span></span>: Add <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-g"><span class="sr-only">{G}</span></span></span> for each creature you control.” The ability is still a mana ability even if you control no creatures or if the permanent is already tapped.
.rule{id: "section-605-3"}
  .rule_id 605.3.
  .rule_text Activating an activated mana ability follows the rules for activating any other activated ability (see rule <a href="#section-602-2">602.2</a>), with the following exceptions:
.rule{id: "section-605-3a"}
  .rule_id 605.3a
  .rule_text A player may activate an activated mana ability whenever they have priority, whenever they are casting a spell or activating an ability that requires a mana payment, or whenever a rule or effect asks for a mana payment, even if it’s in the middle of casting or resolving a spell or activating or resolving an ability.
.rule{id: "section-605-3b"}
  .rule_id 605.3b
  .rule_text An activated mana ability doesn’t go on the stack, so it can’t be targeted, countered, or otherwise responded to. Rather, it resolves immediately after it is activated. (See rule <a href="#section-405-6c">405.6c</a>.)
.rule{id: "section-605-3c"}
  .rule_id 605.3c
  .rule_text Once a player begins to activate a mana ability, that ability can’t be activated again until it has resolved.
.rule{id: "section-605-4"}
  .rule_id 605.4.
  .rule_text Triggered mana abilities follow all the rules for other triggered abilities (see rule <a href="#section-603">603</a>, “Handling Triggered Abilities”), with the following exception:
.rule{id: "section-605-4a"}
  .rule_id 605.4a
  .rule_text A triggered mana ability doesn’t go on the stack, so it can’t be targeted, countered, or otherwise responded to. Rather, it resolves immediately after the mana ability that triggered it, without waiting for priority.
  .rule_text Example: An enchantment reads, “Whenever a player taps a land for mana, that player adds one mana of any type that land produced.” If a player taps lands for mana while casting a spell, the additional mana is added immediately and can be used to pay for the spell.
.rule{id: "section-605-5"}
  .rule_id 605.5.
  .rule_text Abilities that don’t meet the criteria specified in rules <a href="#section-605-1a">605.1a</a>–b and spells aren’t mana abilities.
.rule{id: "section-605-5a"}
  .rule_id 605.5a
  .rule_text An ability with a target is not a mana ability, even if it could put mana into a player’s mana pool when it resolves. The same is true for a triggered ability that could produce mana but triggers from an event other than activating a mana ability, or a triggered ability that triggers from activating a mana ability but couldn’t produce mana. These follow the normal rules for activated or triggered abilities, as appropriate.
.rule{id: "section-605-5b"}
  .rule_id 605.5b
  .rule_text A spell can never be a mana ability, even if it could put mana into a player’s mana pool when it resolves. It’s cast and resolves just like any other spell. Some older cards were printed with the card type “mana source”; these cards have received errata in the Oracle card reference and are now instants.

.rule{id: "section-606-2"}
  .rule_id 606.2.
  .rule_text An activated ability with a loyalty symbol in its cost is a loyalty ability. Normally, only planeswalkers have loyalty abilities.
.rule{id: "section-606-3"}
  .rule_id 606.3.
  .rule_text A player may activate a loyalty ability of a permanent they control any time they have priority and the stack is empty during a main phase of their turn, but only if no player has previously activated a loyalty ability of that permanent that turn.
.rule{id: "section-606-4"}
  .rule_id 606.4.
  .rule_text The cost to activate a loyalty ability of a permanent is to put on or remove from that permanent a certain number of loyalty counters, as shown by the loyalty symbol in the ability’s cost. This cost may be modified by other effects.
.rule{id: "section-606-5"}
  .rule_id 606.5
  .rule_text If the total cost to activate a loyalty ability contains multiple costs to add or remove loyalty counters, those costs are combined into a single cost to add or remove loyalty counters, as appropriate.
  .rule_text Example: A player controls Carth the Lion, which says, in part, “Planeswalkers’ loyalty abilities you control cost an additional <i class="mana mana-loyalty mana-loyalty-up mana-loyalty-1"></i><span class="sr-only">[+1]</span> to activate. That player also controls a planeswalker with three loyalty counters. To activate one of that planeswalker’s abilities that normally costs <i class="mana mana-loyalty mana-loyalty-up mana-loyalty-1"></i><span class="sr-only">[+1]</span>, they put two loyalty counters on it. To activate one of its abilities that normally costs <i class="mana mana-loyalty mana-loyalty-down mana-loyalty-4"></i><span class="sr-only">[–4]</span>, they remove three loyalty counters from it.
.rule{id: "section-606-6"}
  .rule_id 606.6.
  .rule_text A loyalty ability with a negative loyalty cost, taking into account any additional costs, can’t be activated unless the permanent has at least that many loyalty counters on it.

  .rule_text An object may have two abilities printed on it such that one of them causes actions to be taken or objects or players to be affected and the other one directly refers to those actions, objects, or players. If so, these two abilities are linked: the second refers only to actions that were taken or objects or players that were affected by the first, and not by any other ability.
.rule{id: "section-607-1a"}
  .rule_id 607.1a
  .rule_text An ability printed on an object within another ability that grants that ability to that object is considered to be “printed on” that object for these purposes.

  .rule_id 607.1b
  .rule_text An ability printed on either face of a transforming double-faced card (see rule <a href="#section-712">712</a>) is considered to be “printed on” that object for these purposes, regardless of which face is up.
.rule{id: "section-607-1c"}

  .rule_id 607.1d
  .rule_text Abilities printed on two objects can be linked if one object is a token, emblem, or nontoken permanent and the second object was the source of the ability that either created the token or emblem or put that nontoken permanent onto the battlefield. In these cases, the abilities fit the criteria listed for one of the different kinds of linked abilities in rule <a href="#section-607-2">607.2</a> except they are printed on two objects rather than one.

  .rule_text If an object has an activated or triggered ability printed on it that instructs a player to exile one or more cards and an ability printed on it that refers either to “the exiled cards” or to cards “exiled with [this object],” these abilities are linked. The second ability refers only to cards in the exile zone that were put there as a result of an instruction to exile them in the first ability.
.rule{id: "section-607-2b"}
  .rule_id 607.2b
  .rule_text If an object has an ability printed on it that generates a replacement effect which causes one or more cards to be exiled and an ability printed on it that refers either to “the exiled cards” or to cards “exiled with [this object],” these abilities are linked. The second ability refers only to cards in the exile zone that were put there as a direct result of a replacement event caused by the first ability. See rule <a href="#section-614">614</a>, “Replacement Effects.”

  .rule_text If an object has an activated or triggered ability printed on it that puts one or more objects onto the battlefield and an ability printed on it that refers to objects “put onto the battlefield with [this object]” or “created with [this object],” those abilities are linked. The second can refer only to objects put onto the battlefield as a result of the first.
.rule{id: "section-607-2d"}
  .rule_id 607.2d
  .rule_text If an object has an ability printed on it that causes a player to “choose a [value]” and an ability printed on it that refers to “the chosen [value],” “the last chosen [value],” or similar, those abilities are linked. The second ability refers only to a choice made as a result of the first ability.
.rule{id: "section-607-2e"}
  .rule_id 607.2e
  .rule_text If an object has an ability printed on it that allows some information to be noted and another ability which refers to information noted for that object, those abilities are linked. The second ability refers only to information noted as a result of the first ability.
.rule{id: "section-607-2f"}
  .rule_id 607.2f
  .rule_text If an object has an ability printed on it that causes a player to choose from between two or more words that otherwise have no rules meaning and an ability printed on it that refers to a choice involving one or more of those words, those abilities are linked. The second can refer only to a choice made as a result of the first ability.
.rule{id: "section-607-2g"}
  .rule_id 607.2g
  .rule_text If an object has an ability printed on it that causes a player to pay a cost as it enters the battlefield and an ability printed on it that refers to the cost paid “as [this object] entered the battlefield,” these abilities are linked. The second ability refers only to a cost paid as a result of the first ability.
.rule{id: "section-607-2h"}
  .rule_id 607.2h
  .rule_text If an object has both a static ability and one or more triggered abilities printed on it in the same paragraph, each of those triggered abilities is linked to the static ability. Each triggered ability refers only to actions taken as a result of the static ability. See rule <a href="#section-603-11">603.11</a>.
.rule{id: "section-607-2i"}
  .rule_id 607.2i
  .rule_text If an object has a kicker ability printed on it and an ability printed on it that refers to whether that object was kicked, those abilities are linked. The second refers only to whether the intent to pay the kicker cost listed in the first was declared as the object was cast as a spell. If a kicker ability lists multiple costs, it will have multiple abilities linked to it. Each of those abilities will specify which kicker cost it refers to. See rule <a href="#section-702-33">702.33</a>, “Kicker.”
.rule{id: "section-607-2j"}
  .rule_id 607.2j
  .rule_text If an object has an ability printed on it that causes a player to pay a variable additional cost as it’s cast and an ability printed on it that refers to the cost paid “as [this object] was cast,” these abilities are linked. The second refers only to the value chosen for the cost listed in the first as the object was cast as a spell. See rule <a href="#section-601-2b">601.2b</a>.
.rule{id: "section-607-2k"}

.rule{id: "section-607-2n"}
  .rule_id 607.2n
  .rule_text If an object has a static ability printed on it that allows a player to exile one or more cards “before you shuffle your deck to start the game” and an ability printed on it that refers to cards “exiled with cards named [this object’s name],” the second ability is linked to the first ability of any objects that had the specified name before the game began.
.rule{id: "section-607-2p"}
  .rule_id 607.2p
  .rule_text If an object has both a static ability that causes a player to make a choice for a characteristic-defining ability before the game begins and that characteristic-defining ability printed on it in the same paragraph, those abilities are linked. The second ability refers only to the choice made as a result of the first ability and continues to refer to that choice as the object changes zones during the game.
.rule{id: "section-607-2q"}
  .rule_id 607.2q
  .rule_text If a permanent spell has an ability printed on it that allows one or more cards to be exiled while paying a cost to cast it and the permanent that spell becomes has an ability that refers to cards “exiled with [this object],” those abilities are linked. The second ability refers only to cards exiled to pay the cost of the spell that became that permanent.
.rule{id: "section-607-3"}
  .rule_id 607.3.
  .rule_text If, within a pair of linked abilities, one ability refers to a single object as “the exiled card,” “a card exiled with [this card],” or a similar phrase, and the other ability has exiled multiple cards (usually because it was copied), the ability refers to each of the exiled cards. If that ability asks for any information about the exiled card, such as a characteristic or mana value, it gets multiple answers. If these answers are used to determine the value of a variable, the sum of the answers is used. If that ability performs any actions on “the” card, it performs that action on each exiled card. If that ability creates a token that is a copy of “the” card, then for each exiled card, it creates a token that is a copy of that card. If that ability performs any actions on “a” card, the controller of the ability chooses which card is affected.
.rule{id: "section-607-4"}
  .rule_id 607.4.
  .rule_text An ability may be part of more than one pair of linked abilities.
  .rule_text Example: Paradise Plume has the following three abilities: “As Paradise Plume enters the battlefield, choose a color,” “Whenever a player casts a spell of the chosen color, you may gain 1 life,” and “<span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-t"><span class="sr-only">{T}</span></span></span>: Add one mana of the chosen color.” The first and second abilities are linked. The first and third abilities are linked.
.rule{id: "section-607-5"}
  .rule_id 607.5.
  .rule_text If an object acquires a pair of linked abilities as part of the same effect, the abilities will be similarly linked to one another on that object even though they weren’t printed on that object. They can’t be linked to any other ability, regardless of what other abilities the object may currently have or may have had in the past.
  .rule_text Example: Arc-Slogger has the ability “<span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-r"><span class="sr-only">{R}</span></span></span>, Exile the top ten cards of your library: Arc-Slogger deals 2 damage to any target.” Sisters of Stone Death has the ability “<span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-b"><span class="sr-only">{B}</span></span><span class="mana mana-cost mana-g"><span class="sr-only">{G}</span></span></span>: Exile target creature blocking or blocked by Sisters of Stone Death” and the ability “<span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-2"><span class="sr-only">{2}</span></span><span class="mana mana-cost mana-b"><span class="sr-only">{B}</span></span></span>: Put a creature card exiled with Sisters of Stone Death onto the battlefield under your control.” Quicksilver Elemental has the ability “<span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-u"><span class="sr-only">{U}</span></span></span>: Quicksilver Elemental gains all activated abilities of target creature until end of turn.” If a player has Quicksilver Elemental gain Arc-Slogger’s ability, activates it, then has Quicksilver Elemental gain Sisters of Stone Death’s abilities, activates the exile ability, and then activates the return-to-the-battlefield ability, only the creature card Quicksilver Elemental exiled with Sisters of Stone Death’s ability can be returned to the battlefield. Creature cards Quicksilver Elemental exiled with Arc-Slogger’s ability can’t be returned.
.rule{id: "section-607-5a"}
  .rule_id 607.5a
  .rule_text If an object gains an ability that refers to a choice, but either (a) doesn’t copy that ability’s linked ability or (b) does copy the linked ability but no choice is made for it, then the choice is considered to be “undefined.” If an ability refers to an undefined choice, that part of the ability won’t do anything.
  .rule_text Example: Voice of All enters the battlefield and Unstable Shapeshifter copies it. Voice of All reads, in part, “As Voice of All enters the battlefield, choose a color.” and “Voice of All has protection from the chosen color.” Unstable Shapeshifter never had a chance for a color to be chosen for it, because it didn’t enter the battlefield as Voice of All so it doesn’t gain a protection ability.
  .rule_text Example: A Vesuvan Doppelganger enters the battlefield as a copy of Voice of All, and the Doppelganger’s controller chooses blue. Later, the Doppelganger copies Quirion Elves, which has the ability, “<span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-t"><span class="sr-only">{T}</span></span></span>: Add one mana of the chosen color.” Even though a color was chosen for the Doppelganger, it wasn’t chosen for the ability linked to the mana ability copied from the Elves. If that mana ability of the Doppelganger is activated, it will not produce mana.

.rule{id: "section-608-2"}
  .rule_id 608.2.
  .rule_text If the object that’s resolving is an instant spell, a sorcery spell, or an ability, its resolution may involve several steps. The steps described in rules <a href="#section-608-2a">608.2a</a> and <a href="#section-608-2b">608.2b</a> are followed first. The steps described in rules <a href="#section-608-2c">608.2c</a>–k are then followed as appropriate, in no specific order. The step described in rule <a href="#section-608-2m">608.2m</a> is followed last.
.rule{id: "section-608-2a"}
  .rule_id 608.2a
  .rule_text If a triggered ability has an intervening “if” clause, it checks whether the clause’s condition is true. If it isn’t, the ability is removed from the stack and does nothing. Otherwise, it continues to resolve. See rule <a href="#section-603-4">603.4</a>.
.rule{id: "section-608-2b"}
  .rule_id 608.2b
  .rule_text If the spell or ability specifies targets, it checks whether the targets are still legal. A target that’s no longer in the zone it was in when it was targeted is illegal. Other changes to the game state may cause a target to no longer be legal; for example, its characteristics may have changed or an effect may have changed the text of the spell. If the source of an ability has left the zone it was in, its last known information is used during this process. If all its targets, for every instance of the word “target,” are now illegal, the spell or ability doesn’t resolve. It’s removed from the stack and, if it’s a spell, put into its owner’s graveyard. Otherwise, the spell or ability will resolve normally. Illegal targets, if any, won’t be affected by parts of a resolving spell’s effect for which they’re illegal. Other parts of the effect for which those targets are not illegal may still affect them. If the spell or ability creates any continuous effects that affect game rules (see rule <a href="#section-613-11">613.11</a>), those effects don’t apply to illegal targets. If part of the effect requires information about an illegal target, it fails to determine any such information. Any part of the effect that requires that information won’t happen.
  .rule_text Example: Sorin’s Thirst is a black instant that reads, “Sorin’s Thirst deals 2 damage to target creature and you gain 2 life.” If the creature isn’t a legal target during the resolution of Sorin’s Thirst (say, if the creature has gained protection from black or left the battlefield), then Sorin’s Thirst doesn’t resolve. Its controller doesn’t gain any life.
  .rule_text Example: Plague Spores reads, “Destroy target nonblack creature and target land. They can’t be regenerated.” Suppose the same creature land is chosen both as the nonblack creature and as the land, and the color of the creature land is changed to black before Plague Spores resolves. Plague Spores still resolves because the black creature land is still a legal target for the “target land” part of the spell. The “destroy target nonblack creature” part of the spell won’t affect that permanent, but the “destroy target land” part of the spell will still destroy it. It can’t be regenerated.

  .rule_text The controller of the spell or ability follows its instructions in the order written. However, replacement effects may modify these actions. In some cases, later text on the card may modify the meaning of earlier text (for example, “Destroy target creature. It can’t be regenerated” or “Counter target spell. If that spell is countered this way, put it on top of its owner’s library instead of into its owner’s graveyard.”) Don’t just apply effects step by step without thinking in these cases—read the whole text and apply the rules of English to the text.
.rule{id: "section-608-2d"}
  .rule_id 608.2d
  .rule_text If an effect of a spell or ability offers any choices other than choices already made as part of casting the spell, activating the ability, or otherwise putting the spell or ability on the stack, the player announces these while applying the effect. The player can’t choose an option that’s illegal or impossible, with the exception that having a library with no cards in it doesn’t make drawing a card an impossible action (see rule <a href="#section-121-3">121.3</a>). If an effect divides or distributes something, such as damage or counters, as a player chooses among any number of untargeted players and/or objects, the player chooses the amount and division such that each chosen player or object receives at least one of whatever is being divided. (Note that if an effect divides or distributes something, such as damage or counters, as a player chooses among some number of target objects and/or players, the amount and division were determined as the spell or ability was put onto the stack rather than at this time; see rule <a href="#section-601-2d">601.2d</a>.)
  .rule_text Example: A spell’s instruction reads, “You may sacrifice a creature. If you don’t, you lose 4 life.” A player who controls no creatures can’t choose the sacrifice option.
.rule{id: "section-608-2e"}
  .rule_id 608.2e
  .rule_text Some spells and abilities have multiple steps or actions, denoted by separate sentences or clauses, that involve multiple players. In these cases, the choices for the first action are made in APNAP order, and then the first action is processed simultaneously. Then the choices for the second action are made in APNAP order, and then that action is processed simultaneously, and so on. See rule <a href="#section-101-4">101.4</a>.
.rule{id: "section-608-2f"}
  .rule_id 608.2f
  .rule_text Some spells and abilities include actions taken on multiple players and/or objects. In most cases, each such action is processed simultaneously. If the action can’t be processed simultaneously, it’s instead processed considering each affected player or object individually. APNAP order is used to make the primary determination of the order of those actions. Secondarily, if the action is to be taken on both a player and an object they control or on multiple objects controlled by the same player, the player who controls the resolving spell or ability chooses the relative order of those actions.
  .rule_text Example: Blatant Thievery says “For each opponent, gain control of target permanent that player controls.” As Blatant Thievery resolves, its controller gains control of all permanents chosen as targets simultaneously.
  .rule_text Example: Soulfire Eruption says, in part, “Choose any number of target creatures, planeswalkers, and/or players. For each of them, exile the top card of your library, then Soulfire Eruption deals damage equal to that card’s mana value to that permanent or player.” A player casts Soulfire Eruption targeting an opponent and a creature that opponent controls. As Soulfire Eruption resolves, the player can’t exile the top card of their library multiple times at the same time, so they first choose which target they are considering, then they exile the top card of their library, and finally Soulfire Eruption deals damage to that target. They then repeat this process for the remaining target. 
.rule{id: "section-608-2g"}
  .rule_id 608.2g
  .rule_text If an effect gives a player the option to pay mana, they may activate mana abilities before taking that action. If an effect specifically instructs or allows a player to cast a spell during resolution, they do so by following the steps in rules <a href="#section-601-2a">601.2a</a>–i, except no player receives priority after it’s cast. That spell becomes the topmost object on the stack, and the currently resolving spell or ability continues to resolve, which may include casting other spells this way. No other spells can normally be cast and no other abilities can normally be activated during resolution.
.rule{id: "section-608-2h"}
  .rule_id 608.2h
  .rule_text If an effect requires information from the game (such as the number of creatures on the battlefield), the answer is determined only once, when the effect is applied. If the effect requires information from a specific object, including the source of the ability itself, the effect uses the current information of that object if it’s in the public zone it was expected to be in; if it’s no longer in that zone, or if the effect has moved it from a public zone to a hidden zone, the effect uses the object’s last known information. See rule <a href="#section-113-7a">113.7a</a>. If an ability states that an object does something, it’s the object as it exists—or as it most recently existed—that does it, not the ability.
.rule{id: "section-608-2i"}
  .rule_id 608.2i
  .rule_text If an effect refers to certain characteristics, it checks only for the value of the specified characteristics, regardless of any related ones an object may also have.
  .rule_text Example: An effect that reads “Destroy all black creatures” destroys a white-and-black creature, but one that reads “Destroy all nonblack creatures” doesn’t.
.rule{id: "section-608-2j"}
  .rule_id 608.2j
  .rule_text If an ability’s effect refers to a specific untargeted object that has been previously referred to by that ability’s cost or trigger condition, it still affects that object even if the object has changed characteristics.
  .rule_text Example: Wall of Tears says “Whenever Wall of Tears blocks a creature, return that creature to its owner’s hand at end of combat.” If Wall of Tears blocks a creature, then that creature ceases to be a creature before the triggered ability resolves, the permanent will still be returned to its owner’s hand.
.rule{id: "section-608-2k"}
  .rule_id 608.2k
  .rule_text If an instant spell, sorcery spell, or ability that can legally resolve leaves the stack once it starts to resolve, it will continue to resolve fully.
.rule{id: "section-608-2m"}
  .rule_id 608.2m
  .rule_text As the final part of an instant or sorcery spell’s resolution, the spell is put into its owner’s graveyard. As the final part of an ability’s resolution, the ability is removed from the stack and ceases to exist.
.rule{id: "section-608-3"}
  .rule_id 608.3.
  .rule_text If the object that’s resolving is a permanent spell, its resolution may involve several steps. The instructions in rules <a href="#section-608-3a">608.3a</a> and b are always performed first. Then one of the steps in rule <a href="#section-608-3c">608.3c</a>–e is performed, if appropriate.
.rule{id: "section-608-3a"}
  .rule_id 608.3a
  .rule_text If the object that’s resolving has no targets, it becomes a permanent and enters the battlefield under the control of the spell’s controller.
.rule{id: "section-608-3b"}
  .rule_id 608.3b
  .rule_text If the object that’s resolving has a target, it checks whether the target is still legal, as described in <a href="#section-608-2b">608.2b</a>. If a spell with an illegal target is a bestowed Aura spell (see rule <a href="#section-702-103e">702.103e</a>) or a mutating creature spell (see rule <a href="#section-702-140b">702.140b</a>), it becomes a creature spell and will resolve as described in rule <a href="#section-608-3a">608.3a</a>. Otherwise, the spell doesn’t resolve. It is removed from the stack and put into its owner’s graveyard.
.rule{id: "section-608-3c"}
  .rule_id 608.3c
  .rule_text If the object that’s resolving is an Aura spell, it becomes a permanent and is put onto the battlefield under the control of the spell’s controller attached to the player or object it was targeting.
.rule{id: "section-608-3d"}
  .rule_id 608.3d
  .rule_text If the object that’s resolving is a mutating creature spell, the object representing that spell merges with the permanent it is targeting (see rule <a href="#section-725">725</a>, “Merging with Permanents”).
.rule{id: "section-608-3e"}
  .rule_id 608.3e
  .rule_text If a permanent spell resolves but its controller can’t put it onto the battlefield, that player puts it into its owner’s graveyard.
  .rule_text Example: Worms of the Earth has the ability “Lands can’t enter the battlefield.” Clone says “You may have Clone enter the battlefield as a copy of any creature on the battlefield.” If a player casts Clone and chooses to copy Dryad Arbor (a land creature) while Worms of the Earth is on the battlefield, Clone can’t enter the battlefield from the stack. It’s put into its owner’s graveyard.
.rule{id: "section-608-3f"}
  .rule_id 608.3f
  .rule_text If the object that’s resolving is a copy of a permanent spell, it will become a token permanent as it is put onto the battlefield in any of the steps above. A token put onto the battlefield this way is no longer a copy of a spell and is not “created” for the purposes of any rules or effects that refer to creating a token.
.rule{id: "section-608-3g"}
  .rule_id 608.3g
  .rule_text If the object that’s resolving has a static ability that functions on the stack and creates a delayed triggered ability, that delayed triggered ability is created as that permanent is put onto the battlefield in any of the steps above. (See rules <a href="#section-702-109">702.109</a>, “Dash,” and rule <a href="#section-702-152">702.152</a>, “Blitz.”)

  .rule_text Effects
.rule{id: "section-609-1"}
  .rule_id 609.1.
  .rule_text An effect is something that happens in the game as a result of a spell or ability. When a spell, activated ability, or triggered ability resolves, it may create one or more one-shot or continuous effects. Static abilities may create one or more continuous effects. Text itself is never an effect.
.rule{id: "section-609-2"}
  .rule_id 609.2.
  .rule_text Effects apply only to permanents unless the instruction’s text states otherwise or they clearly can apply only to objects in one or more other zones.
  .rule_text Example: An effect that changes all lands into creatures won’t alter land cards in players’ graveyards. But an effect that says spells cost more to cast will apply only to spells on the stack, since a spell is always on the stack while a player is casting it.
.rule{id: "section-609-3"}
  .rule_id 609.3.
  .rule_text If an effect attempts to do something impossible, it does only as much as possible.
  .rule_text Example: If a player is holding only one card, an effect that reads “Discard two cards” causes them to discard only that card. If an effect moves cards out of the library (as opposed to drawing), it moves as many as possible.
.rule{id: "section-609-4"}
  .rule_id 609.4.
  .rule_text Some effects state that a player may do something “as though” some condition were true or a creature can do something “as though” some condition were true. This applies only to the stated effect. For purposes of that effect, treat the game exactly as if the stated condition were true. For all other purposes, treat the game normally.
.rule{id: "section-609-4a"}
  .rule_id 609.4a
  .rule_text If two effects state that a player may (or a creature can) do the same thing “as though” different conditions were true, both conditions could apply. If one “as though” effect satisfies the requirements for another “as though” effect, then both effects will apply.
  .rule_text Example: A player controls Vedalken Orrery, an artifact that says “You may cast spells as though they had flash.” That player casts Shaman’s Trance, an instant that says, in part, “You may play lands and cast spells from other players’ graveyards this turn as though those cards were in your graveyard.” The player may cast a sorcery with flashback from another player’s graveyard as though it were in that player’s graveyard and as though it had flash.
.rule{id: "section-609-4b"}
  .rule_id 609.4b
  .rule_text If an effect allows a player to spend mana “as though it were mana of any [type or color],” this affects only how the player may pay a cost. It doesn’t change that cost, and it doesn’t change what mana was actually spent to pay that cost.
.rule{id: "section-609-5"}
  .rule_id 609.5.
  .rule_text If an effect could result in a tie, the text of the spell or ability that created the effect will specify what to do in the event of a tie. The Magic game has no default for ties.
.rule{id: "section-609-6"}
  .rule_id 609.6.
  .rule_text Some continuous effects are replacement effects or prevention effects. See rules <a href="#section-614">614</a> and <a href="#section-615">615</a>.
.rule{id: "section-609-7"}
  .rule_id 609.7.
  .rule_text Some effects apply to damage from a source—for example, “The next time a red source of your choice would deal damage to you this turn, prevent that damage.”
.rule{id: "section-609-7a"}
  .rule_id 609.7a
  .rule_text If an effect requires a player to choose a source of damage, they may choose a permanent; a spell on the stack (including a permanent spell); any object referred to by an object on the stack, by a replacement or prevention effect that’s waiting to apply, or by a delayed triggered ability that’s waiting to trigger (even if that object is no longer in the zone it used to be in); or a face-up object in the command zone. A source doesn’t need to be capable of dealing damage to be a legal choice. The source is chosen when the effect is created. If the player chooses a permanent, the effect will apply to the next damage dealt by that permanent, regardless of whether it’s combat damage or damage dealt as the result of a spell or ability. If the player chooses a permanent spell, the effect will apply to any damage dealt by that spell and any damage dealt by the permanent that spell becomes when it resolves.
.rule{id: "section-609-7b"}
  .rule_id 609.7b
  .rule_text Some effects from resolved spells and abilities prevent or replace damage from sources with certain properties, such as a creature or a source of a particular color. When the source would deal damage, the “shield” rechecks the source’s properties. If the properties no longer match, the damage isn’t prevented or replaced. If for any reason the shield prevents no damage or replaces no damage, the shield isn’t used up.
.rule{id: "section-609-7c"}
  .rule_id 609.7c
  .rule_text Some effects from static abilities prevent or replace damage from sources with certain properties. For these effects, the prevention or replacement applies to sources that are permanents with that property and to any sources that aren’t on the battlefield that have that property.
.rule{id: "section-609-8"}
  .rule_id 609.8.
  .rule_text Some effects look back in time and consider previous game states and actions rather than considering the current game state. If such an effect refers to an object or group of objects, those objects don’t need to be currently in the zone they were in at the time of the action, nor do they need to currently meet the criteria described in the action, as long as they did so at the specified time.
  .rule_text Example: A player attacks with Bear Cub. Later in the turn, an effect causes Bear Cub to become a noncreature permanent. The same player then casts Search Party Captain, a spell that says in part “This spell costs <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-1"><span class="sr-only">{1}</span></span></span> less to cast for each creature you attacked with this turn.” That spell costs <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-1"><span class="sr-only">{1}</span></span></span> less because the player attacked with a creature, even though the Bear Cub they attacked with is no longer a creature.

  .rule_text One-Shot Effects
.rule{id: "section-610-1"}
  .rule_id 610.1.
  .rule_text A one-shot effect does something just once and doesn’t have a duration. Examples include dealing damage, destroying a permanent, creating a token, and moving an object from one zone to another.
.rule{id: "section-610-2"}
  .rule_id 610.2.
  .rule_text Some one-shot effects create a delayed triggered ability, which instructs a player to do something later in the game (usually at a specific time) rather than as the spell or ability that’s creating the one-shot effect resolves. See rule <a href="#section-603-7">603.7</a>.
.rule{id: "section-610-3"}
  .rule_id 610.3.
  .rule_text Some one-shot effects cause an object to change zones “until” a specified event occurs. A second one-shot effect is created immediately after the specified event. This second one-shot effect returns the object to its previous zone.
.rule{id: "section-610-3a"}
  .rule_id 610.3a
  .rule_text If a resolving spell or activated ability creates the initial one-shot effect that causes the object to change zones, and the specified event has already occurred before that one-shot effect would occur but after that spell or ability was put onto the stack, the object doesn’t move.
.rule{id: "section-610-3b"}
  .rule_id 610.3b
  .rule_text If a resolving triggered ability creates the initial one-shot effect that causes the object to change zones, and the specified event has already occurred before that one-shot effect would occur but after that ability triggered, the object doesn’t move.
.rule{id: "section-610-3c"}
  .rule_id 610.3c
  .rule_text An object returned to the battlefield this way returns under its owner’s control unless otherwise specified.
.rule{id: "section-610-3d"}
  .rule_id 610.3d
  .rule_text If multiple one-shot effects are created this way immediately after one or more simultaneous events, those one-shot effects are also simultaneous.
  .rule_text Example: Two Banisher Priests have each exiled a card. All creatures are destroyed at the same time by Day of Judgment. The two exiled cards are returned to the battlefield at the same time.
.rule{id: "section-610-4"}
  .rule_id 610.4.
  .rule_text Some one-shot effects cause a permanent to phase out “until” a specified event occurs. A second one-shot effect is created immediately after the specified event. This second one-shot effect causes the permanent to phase in.
.rule{id: "section-610-4a"}
  .rule_id 610.4a
  .rule_text A permanent phased out this way doesn’t phase in as a result of the turn-based action during a player’s untap step (see rule <a href="#section-502-1">502.1</a>). Other effects may cause it to phase in. If a permanent phased out this way phases in due to another effect, the second one-shot effect doesn’t happen, even if that permanent has phased out again.
.rule{id: "section-610-4b"}
  .rule_id 610.4b
  .rule_text If a resolving spell or activated ability creates the initial one-shot effect that causes the permanent to phase out, and the specified event has already occurred before that one-shot effect would occur but after that spell or ability was put onto the stack, the permanent doesn’t phase out.
.rule{id: "section-610-4c"}
  .rule_id 610.4c
  .rule_text If a resolving triggered ability creates the initial one-shot effect that causes the permanent to phase out, and the specified event has already occurred before that one-shot effect would occur but after that ability triggered, the permanent doesn’t phase out.

  .rule_text Continuous Effects
.rule{id: "section-611-1"}
  .rule_id 611.1.

.rule{id: "section-611-2"}
  .rule_id 611.2.
  .rule_text A continuous effect may be generated by the resolution of a spell or ability.
.rule{id: "section-611-2a"}
  .rule_id 611.2a
  .rule_text A continuous effect generated by the resolution of a spell or ability lasts as long as stated by the spell or ability creating it (such as “until end of turn”). If no duration is stated, it lasts until the end of the game.
.rule{id: "section-611-2b"}
  .rule_id 611.2b
  .rule_text Some continuous effects generated by the resolution of a spell or ability have durations worded “for as long as . . . .” If the “for as long as” duration never starts, or it ends before the moment the effect would first be applied, the effect does nothing. It doesn’t start and immediately stop again, and it doesn’t last forever.
  .rule_text Example: Master Thief has the ability “When Master Thief enters the battlefield, gain control of target artifact for as long as you control Master Thief.” If you lose control of Master Thief before the ability resolves, it does nothing, because its duration—as long as you control Master Thief—was over before the effect began.
.rule{id: "section-611-2c"}
  .rule_id 611.2c
  .rule_text If a continuous effect generated by the resolution of a spell or ability modifies the characteristics or changes the controller of any objects, the set of objects it affects is determined when that continuous effect begins. After that point, the set won’t change. (Note that this works differently than a continuous effect from a static ability.) A continuous effect generated by the resolution of a spell or ability that doesn’t modify the characteristics or change the controller of any objects modifies the rules of the game, so it can affect objects that weren’t affected when that continuous effect began. If a single continuous effect has parts that modify the characteristics or changes the controller of any objects and other parts that don’t, the set of objects each part applies to is determined independently.
  .rule_text Example: An effect that reads “All white creatures get +1/+1 until end of turn” gives the bonus to all permanents that are white creatures when the spell or ability resolves—even if they change color later—and doesn’t affect those that enter the battlefield or turn white afterward.
  .rule_text Example: An effect that reads “Prevent all damage creatures would deal this turn” doesn’t modify any object’s characteristics, so it’s modifying the rules of the game. That means the effect will apply even to damage from creatures that weren’t on the battlefield when the continuous effect began. It also affects damage from permanents that become creatures later in the turn.
.rule{id: "section-611-2d"}
  .rule_id 611.2d
  .rule_text If a resolving spell or ability that creates a continuous effect contains a variable such as X, the value of that variable is determined only once, on resolution. See rule <a href="#section-608-2h">608.2h</a>.
.rule{id: "section-611-2e"}
  .rule_id 611.2e
  .rule_text If a resolving spell or ability both puts a nontoken permanent onto the battlefield and creates a continuous effect stating that the permanent “is [characteristic],” that continuous effect applies simultaneously with the permanent entering the battlefield. This characteristic is usually a color or a creature type. If the continuous effect says the permanent “becomes [characteristic]” or “gains [an ability],” that effect applies after the permanent is on the battlefield.
  .rule_text Example: Arbiter of the Ideal puts an artifact, creature, or land card onto the battlefield and says, in part, “That permanent is an enchantment in addition to its other types.” An ability that triggers whenever an enchantment enters the battlefield would trigger. The permanent doesn’t enter the battlefield and then become an enchantment.
.rule{id: "section-611-2f"}
  .rule_id 611.2f
  .rule_text Some spells and abilities generate a continuous effect that modifies the characteristics of the next spell a player casts, the next spell that fulfills certain conditions a player casts during some duration, or similar. These effects do not begin immediately. Rather, they begin to apply at the time that player next puts an appropriate spell on the stack, and they apply to that spell. See rule <a href="#section-601-2a">601.2a</a>.
.rule{id: "section-611-3"}

  .rule_text A continuous effect may be generated by the static ability of an object.
.rule{id: "section-611-3a"}

  .rule_text A continuous effect generated by a static ability isn’t “locked in”; it applies at any given moment to whatever its text indicates.
.rule{id: "section-611-3b"}
  .rule_id 611.3b
  .rule_text The effect applies at all times that the permanent generating it is on the battlefield or the object generating it is in the appropriate zone.
  .rule_text Example: A permanent with the static ability “All white creatures get +1/+1” generates an effect that continuously gives +1/+1 to each white creature on the battlefield. If a creature becomes white, it gets this bonus; a creature that stops being white loses it.
.rule{id: "section-611-3c"}
  .rule_id 611.3c
  .rule_text Continuous effects that modify characteristics of permanents do so simultaneously with the permanent entering the battlefield. They don’t wait until the permanent is on the battlefield and then change it. Because such effects apply as the permanent enters the battlefield, they are applied before determining whether the permanent will cause an ability to trigger when it enters the battlefield.
  .rule_text Example: A permanent with the static ability “All white creatures get +1/+1” is on the battlefield. A creature spell that would normally create a 1/1 white creature instead creates a 2/2 white creature. The creature doesn’t enter the battlefield as 1/1 and then change to 2/2.
.rule{id: "section-611-3d"}
  .rule_id 611.3d
  .rule_text Continuous effects from static abilities may allow a player to play a land or cast a permanent spell, or may grant an ability to a permanent spell or card that allows it to be cast. If the effect also grants that object an ability that functions only on the battlefield, that ability lasts as long as stated by the effect granting that permission or ability. If no duration is stated, it lasts until the end of the game. This is an exception to rules <a href="#section-611-3a">611.3a</a>–b.

  .rule_text A text-changing effect changes only those words that are used in the correct way (for example, a Magic color word being used as a color word, a land type word used as a land type, or a creature type word used as a creature type). An effect that changes a color word or a subtype can’t change a card name, even if that name contains a word or a series of letters that is the same as a Magic color word, basic land type, or creature type.
.rule{id: "section-612-2a"}
  .rule_id 612.2a
  .rule_text Most spells and abilities that create creature tokens use creature types to define both the creature types and the names of the tokens.

.rule{id: "section-612-10"}
  .rule_id 612.10.
  .rule_text A splice ability changes a spell’s text by adding the rules text of the card with splice to the spell, following that spell’s own rules text. It doesn’t modify or replace any of that spell’s own text. (See rule <a href="#section-702-47">702.47</a>, “Splice.”)

  .rule_text Interaction of Continuous Effects
.rule{id: "section-613-1"}
  .rule_id 613.1.
  .rule_text The values of an object’s characteristics are determined by starting with the actual object. For a card, that means the values of the characteristics printed on that card. For a token or a copy of a spell or card, that means the values of the characteristics defined by the effect that created it. Then all applicable continuous effects are applied in a series of layers in the following order:
.rule{id: "section-613-1a"}
  .rule_id 613.1a
  .rule_text Layer 1: Rules and effects that modify copiable values are applied.
.rule{id: "section-613-1b"}
  .rule_id 613.1b
  .rule_text Layer 2: Control-changing effects are applied.
.rule{id: "section-613-1c"}
  .rule_id 613.1c
  .rule_text Layer 3: Text-changing effects are applied. See rule <a href="#section-612">612</a>, “Text-Changing Effects.”
.rule{id: "section-613-1d"}
  .rule_id 613.1d
  .rule_text Layer 4: Type-changing effects are applied. These include effects that change an object’s card type, subtype, and/or supertype.
.rule{id: "section-613-1e"}
  .rule_id 613.1e
  .rule_text Layer 5: Color-changing effects are applied.
.rule{id: "section-613-1f"}
  .rule_id 613.1f
  .rule_text Layer 6: Ability-adding effects, keyword counters, ability-removing effects, and effects that say an object can’t have an ability are applied.
.rule{id: "section-613-1g"}
  .rule_id 613.1g
  .rule_text Layer 7: Power- and/or toughness-changing effects are applied.
.rule{id: "section-613-2"}
  .rule_id 613.2.
  .rule_text Within layer 1, apply effects in a series of sublayers in the order described below. Within each sublayer, apply effects in timestamp order (see rule <a href="#section-613-7">613.7</a>). Note that dependency may alter the order in which effects are applied within a sublayer. (See rule <a href="#section-613-8">613.8</a>.)
.rule{id: "section-613-2a"}
  .rule_id 613.2a
  .rule_text Layer 1a: Copiable effects are applied. This includes copy effects (see rule <a href="#section-707">707</a>, “Copying Objects”) and changes to an object’s characteristics determined by merging an object with a permanent (see rule <a href="#section-725">725</a>, “Merging with Permanents”). “As . . . enters the battlefield” and “as . . . is turned face up” abilities generate copiable effects if they set power and toughness, even if they also define other characteristics.
.rule{id: "section-613-2b"}
  .rule_id 613.2b
  .rule_text Layer 1b: Face-down spells and permanents have their characteristics modified as defined in rule <a href="#section-708-2">708.2</a>.
.rule{id: "section-613-2c"}
  .rule_id 613.2c
  .rule_text After all rules and effects in layer 1 have been applied, the object’s characteristics are its copiable values. (See rule <a href="#section-707-2">707.2</a>.)
.rule{id: "section-613-3"}
  .rule_id 613.3.
  .rule_text Within layers 2–6, apply effects from characteristic-defining abilities first (see rule <a href="#section-604-3">604.3</a>), then all other effects in timestamp order (see rule <a href="#section-613-7">613.7</a>). Note that dependency may alter the order in which effects are applied within a layer. (See rule <a href="#section-613-8">613.8</a>.)
.rule{id: "section-613-4"}
  .rule_id 613.4.
  .rule_text Within layer 7, apply effects in a series of sublayers in the order described below. Within each sublayer, apply effects in timestamp order. (See rule <a href="#section-613-7">613.7</a>.) Note that dependency may alter the order in which effects are applied within a sublayer. (See rule <a href="#section-613-8">613.8</a>.)
.rule{id: "section-613-4a"}
  .rule_id 613.4a
  .rule_text Layer 7a: Effects from characteristic-defining abilities that define power and/or toughness are applied. See rule <a href="#section-604-3">604.3</a>.
.rule{id: "section-613-4b"}
  .rule_id 613.4b
  .rule_text Layer 7b: Effects that set power and/or toughness to a specific number or value are applied. Effects that refer to the base power and/or toughness of a creature apply in this layer.
.rule{id: "section-613-4c"}
  .rule_id 613.4c
  .rule_text Layer 7c: Effects and counters that modify power and/or toughness (but don’t set power and/or toughness to a specific number or value) are applied.
.rule{id: "section-613-4d"}
  .rule_id 613.4d
  .rule_text Layer 7d: Effects that switch a creature’s power and toughness are applied. Such effects take the value of power and apply it to the creature’s toughness, and take the value of toughness and apply it to the creature’s power.
  .rule_text Example: A 1/3 creature is given +0/+1 by an effect. Then another effect switches the creature’s power and toughness. Its new power and toughness is 4/1. A new effect gives the creature +5/+0. Its “unswitched” power and toughness would be 6/4, so its actual power and toughness is 4/6.
  .rule_text Example: A 1/3 creature is given +0/+1 by an effect. Then another effect switches the creature’s power and toughness. Its new power and toughness is 4/1. If the +0/+1 effect ends before the switch effect ends, the creature becomes 3/1.
  .rule_text Example: A 1/3 creature is given +0/+1 by an effect. Then another effect switches the creature’s power and toughness. Then another effect switches its power and toughness again. The two switches essentially cancel each other, and the creature becomes 1/4.
.rule{id: "section-613-5"}
  .rule_id 613.5.
  .rule_text The application of continuous effects as described by the layer system is continually and automatically performed by the game. All resulting changes to an object’s characteristics are instantaneous.
  .rule_text Example: Honor of the Pure is an enchantment that reads “White creatures you control get +1/+1.” Honor of the Pure and a 2/2 black creature are on the battlefield under your control. If an effect then turns the creature white (layer 5), it gets +1/+1 from Honor of the Pure (layer 7c), becoming 3/3. If the creature’s color is later changed to red (layer 5), Honor of the Pure’s effect stops applying to it, and it will return to being 2/2.
  .rule_text Example: Gray Ogre, a 2/2 creature, is on the battlefield. An effect puts a +1/+1 counter on it (layer 7c), making it 3/3. A spell targeting it that says “Target creature gets +4/+4 until end of turn” resolves (layer 7c), making it 7/7. An enchantment that says “Creatures you control get +0/+2” enters the battlefield (layer 7c), making it 7/9. An effect that says “Target creature becomes 0/1 until end of turn” is applied to it (layer 7b), making it 5/8 (0/1, with +4/+4 from the resolved spell, +0/+2 from the enchantment, and +1/+1 from the counter).
.rule{id: "section-613-6"}
  .rule_id 613.6.
  .rule_text If an effect should be applied in different layers and/or sublayers, the parts of the effect each apply in their appropriate ones. If an effect starts to apply in one layer and/or sublayer, it will continue to be applied to the same set of objects in each other applicable layer and/or sublayer, even if the ability generating the effect is removed during this process.
  .rule_text Example: An effect that reads “Wild Mongrel gets +1/+1 and becomes the color of your choice until end of turn” is both a power- and toughness-changing effect and a color-changing effect. The “becomes the color of your choice” part is applied in layer 5, and then the “gets +1/+1” part is applied in layer 7c.
  .rule_text Example: Act of Treason has an effect that reads “Gain control of target creature until end of turn. Untap that creature. It gains haste until end of turn.” This is both a control-changing effect and an effect that adds an ability to an object. The “gain control” part is applied in layer 2, and then the “it gains haste” part is applied in layer 6.
  .rule_text Example: An effect that reads “All noncreature artifacts become 2/2 artifact creatures until end of turn” is both a type-changing effect and a power- and toughness-setting effect. The type-changing effect is applied to all noncreature artifacts in layer 4 and the power- and toughness-setting effect is applied to those same permanents in layer 7b, even though those permanents aren’t noncreature artifacts by then.
  .rule_text Example: Svogthos, the Restless Tomb, is on the battlefield. An effect that says “Until end of turn, target land becomes a 3/3 creature that’s still a land” is applied to it (layers 4 and 7b). An effect that says “Target creature gets +1/+1 until end of turn” is applied to it (layer 7c), making it a 4/4 land creature. Then while you have ten creature cards in your graveyard, you activate Svogthos’s ability: “Until end of turn, Svogthos, the Restless Tomb becomes a black and green Plant Zombie creature with ‘This creature’s power and toughness are each equal to the number of creature cards in your graveyard.’ It’s still a land.” (layers 4, 5, and 7b). It becomes an 11/11 land creature. If a creature card enters or leaves your graveyard, Svogthos’s power and toughness will be modified accordingly. If the first effect is applied to it again, it will become a 4/4 land creature again.
.rule{id: "section-613-7"}
  .rule_id 613.7.
  .rule_text Within a layer or sublayer, determining which order effects are applied in is usually done using a timestamp system. An effect with an earlier timestamp is applied before an effect with a later timestamp.
.rule{id: "section-613-7a"}
  .rule_id 613.7a
  .rule_text A continuous effect generated by a static ability has the same timestamp as the object the static ability is on, or the timestamp of the effect that created the ability, whichever is later. If the effect that created the ability has the later timestamp and the object the ability is on receives a new timestamp, each continuous effect generated by static abilities of that object receives a new timestamp as well, but the relative order of those timestamps remains the same.
  .rule_text Example: Rune of Flight is an Aura that grants enchanted Equipment “Equipped creature has flying.” A player attaches Rune of Flight to Colossus Hammer, an Equipment with “Equipped creature gets +10/+10 and loses flying.” The ability granted by Rune of Flight shares Rune of Flight’s timestamp because it is later than Colossus Hammer’s timestamp. If Colossus Hammer becomes attached to a creature, both of its abilities receive new timestamps (see rule <a href="#section-613-7e">613.7e</a>), but the relative order of those timestamps remains the same.
.rule{id: "section-613-7b"}
  .rule_id 613.7b
  .rule_text A continuous effect generated by the resolution of a spell or ability receives a timestamp at the time it’s created.
.rule{id: "section-613-7c"}
  .rule_id 613.7c
  .rule_text Each counter receives a timestamp as it’s put on an object or player. If that object or player already has a counter of that kind on it, each counter of that kind receives a new timestamp identical to that of the new counter.
.rule{id: "section-613-7d"}
  .rule_id 613.7d
  .rule_text An object receives a timestamp at the time it enters a zone.
.rule{id: "section-613-7e"}
  .rule_id 613.7e
  .rule_text An Aura, Equipment, or Fortification receives a new timestamp each time it becomes attached to an object or player.
.rule{id: "section-613-7f"}
  .rule_id 613.7f
  .rule_text A permanent receives a new timestamp each time it turns face up or face down.
.rule{id: "section-613-7g"}
  .rule_id 613.7g
  .rule_text A transforming double-faced permanent receives a new timestamp each time it transforms or converts.
.rule{id: "section-613-7h"}
  .rule_id 613.7h
  .rule_text A face-up plane card, phenomenon card, or scheme card receives a timestamp at the time it’s turned face up.
.rule{id: "section-613-7i"}
  .rule_id 613.7i
  .rule_text A face-up vanguard card receives a timestamp at the beginning of the game.
.rule{id: "section-613-7j"}
  .rule_id 613.7j
  .rule_text A conspiracy card receives a timestamp at the beginning of the game. If it’s face down, it receives a new timestamp at the time it turns face up.
.rule{id: "section-613-7k"}
  .rule_id 613.7k
  .rule_text A sticker receives a new timestamp each time it’s put on an object. If the object a sticker is on receives a new timestamp, the sticker receives a new timestamp immediately after that one. If the object a sticker is on becomes part of a merged permanent on the battlefield, the sticker receives a new timestamp at that time. If an object has more than one sticker on it as it enters a zone or becomes part of a merged permanent, the relative timestamp order of those stickers remains unchanged.
.rule{id: "section-613-7m"}
  .rule_id 613.7m
  .rule_text If two or more objects would receive a timestamp simultaneously, such as by entering a zone simultaneously or becoming attached simultaneously, their relative timestamps are determined in APNAP order (see rule <a href="#section-101-4">101.4</a>). Objects controlled by the active player (or owned by the active player, if they have no controller) have an earlier relative timestamp in the order of that player’s choice, followed by each other player in turn order.
.rule{id: "section-613-8"}
  .rule_id 613.8.
  .rule_text Within a layer or sublayer, determining which order effects are applied in is sometimes done using a dependency system. If a dependency exists, it will override the timestamp system.
.rule{id: "section-613-8a"}
  .rule_id 613.8a
  .rule_text An effect is said to “depend on” another if (a) it’s applied in the same layer (and, if applicable, sublayer) as the other effect; (b) applying the other would change the text or the existence of the first effect, what it applies to, or what it does to any of the things it applies to; and (c) neither effect is from a characteristic-defining ability or both effects are from characteristic-defining abilities. Otherwise, the effect is considered to be independent of the other effect.
.rule{id: "section-613-8b"}
  .rule_id 613.8b
  .rule_text An effect dependent on one or more other effects waits to apply until just after all of those effects have been applied. If multiple dependent effects would apply simultaneously in this way, they’re applied in timestamp order relative to each other. If several dependent effects form a dependency loop, then this rule is ignored and the effects in the dependency loop are applied in timestamp order.
.rule{id: "section-613-8c"}
  .rule_id 613.8c
  .rule_text After each effect is applied, the order of remaining effects is reevaluated and may change if an effect that has not yet been applied becomes dependent on or independent of one or more other effects that have not yet been applied.
.rule{id: "section-613-9"}
  .rule_id 613.9.
  .rule_text One continuous effect can override another. Sometimes the results of one effect determine whether another effect applies or what another effect does.
  .rule_text Example: Two effects are affecting the same creature: one from an Aura that says “Enchanted creature has flying” and one from an Aura that says “Enchanted creature loses flying.” Neither of these depends on the other, since nothing changes what they affect or what they’re doing to it. Applying them in timestamp order means the one that was generated last “wins.” The same process would be followed, and the same result reached, if either of the effects had a duration (such as “Target creature loses flying until end of turn”) or came from a non-Aura source (such as “All creatures lose flying”).
  .rule_text Example: One effect reads, “White creatures get +1/+1,” and another reads, “Enchanted creature is white.” The enchanted creature gets +1/+1 from the first effect, regardless of its previous color.
.rule{id: "section-613-10"}
  .rule_id 613.10.
  .rule_text Some continuous effects affect players rather than objects. For example, an effect might give a player protection from red. All such effects are applied in timestamp order after the determination of objects’ characteristics. See also the rules for timestamp order and dependency (rules <a href="#section-613-7">613.7</a> and <a href="#section-613-8">613.8</a>).
.rule{id: "section-613-11"}
  .rule_id 613.11.
  .rule_text Some continuous effects affect game rules rather than objects. For example, effects may modify a player’s maximum hand size, or say that a creature must attack this turn if able. These effects are applied after all other continuous effects have been applied. Continuous effects that affect the costs of spells or abilities are applied according to the order specified in rule <a href="#section-601-2f">601.2f</a>. All other such effects are applied in timestamp order. See also the rules for timestamp order and dependency (rules <a href="#section-613-7">613.7</a> and <a href="#section-613-8">613.8</a>).
.rule{id: "section-614"}
  .rule_id 614.
  .rule_text Replacement Effects
.rule{id: "section-614-1"}
  .rule_id 614.1.
  .rule_text Some continuous effects are replacement effects. Like prevention effects (see rule <a href="#section-615">615</a>), replacement effects apply continuously as events happen—they aren’t locked in ahead of time. Such effects watch for a particular event that would happen and completely or partially replace that event with a different event. They act like “shields” around whatever they’re affecting.
.rule{id: "section-614-1a"}
  .rule_id 614.1a
  .rule_text Effects that use the word “instead” are replacement effects. Most replacement effects use the word “instead” to indicate what events will be replaced with other events.
.rule{id: "section-614-1b"}
  .rule_id 614.1b
  .rule_text Effects that use the word “skip” are replacement effects. These replacement effects use the word “skip” to indicate what events, steps, phases, or turns will be replaced with nothing.
.rule{id: "section-614-1c"}
  .rule_id 614.1c
  .rule_text Effects that read “[This permanent] enters the battlefield with . . . ,” “As [this permanent] enters the battlefield . . . ,” or “[This permanent] enters the battlefield as . . . “ are replacement effects.
.rule{id: "section-614-1d"}
  .rule_id 614.1d
  .rule_text Continuous effects that read “[This permanent] enters the battlefield . . .” or “[Objects] enter the battlefield . . .” are replacement effects.
.rule{id: "section-614-1e"}
  .rule_id 614.1e
  .rule_text Effects that read “As [this permanent] is turned face up . . . ,” are replacement effects.
.rule{id: "section-614-2"}
  .rule_id 614.2.
  .rule_text Some replacement effects apply to damage from a source. See rule <a href="#section-609-7">609.7</a>.
.rule{id: "section-614-3"}
  .rule_id 614.3.
  .rule_text There are no special restrictions on casting a spell or activating an ability that generates a replacement effect. Such effects last until they’re used up or their duration has expired.
.rule{id: "section-614-4"}
  .rule_id 614.4.
  .rule_text Replacement effects must exist before the appropriate event occurs—they can’t “go back in time” and change something that’s already happened. Spells or abilities that generate these effects are often cast or activated in response to whatever would produce the event and thus resolve before that event would occur.
  .rule_text Example: A player can activate an ability to regenerate a creature in response to a spell that would destroy it. Once the spell resolves, though, it’s too late to regenerate the creature.
.rule{id: "section-614-5"}
  .rule_id 614.5.
  .rule_text A replacement effect doesn’t invoke itself repeatedly; it gets only one opportunity to affect an event or any modified events that may replace that event.
  .rule_text Example: A player controls two permanents, each with an ability that reads “If a creature you control would deal damage to a permanent or player, it deals double that damage to that permanent or player instead.” A creature that normally deals 2 damage will deal 8 damage—not just 4, and not an infinite amount.
.rule{id: "section-614-6"}
  .rule_id 614.6.
  .rule_text If an event is replaced, it never happens. A modified event occurs instead, which may in turn trigger abilities. Note that the modified event may contain instructions that can’t be carried out, in which case the impossible instruction is simply ignored.
.rule{id: "section-614-7"}
  .rule_id 614.7.
  .rule_text If a replacement effect would replace an event, but that event never happens, the replacement effect simply doesn’t do anything.
.rule{id: "section-614-7a"}
  .rule_id 614.7a
  .rule_text If a source would deal 0 damage, it does not deal damage at all. Replacement effects that would increase the damage dealt by that source, or would have that source deal that damage to a different object or player, have no event to replace, so they have no effect.
.rule{id: "section-614-8"}
  .rule_id 614.8.
  .rule_text Regeneration is a destruction-replacement effect. The word “instead” doesn’t appear on the card but is implicit in the definition of regeneration. “Regenerate [permanent]” means “The next time [permanent] would be destroyed this turn, instead remove all damage marked on it and tap it. If it’s an attacking or blocking creature, remove it from combat.” Abilities that trigger from damage being dealt still trigger even if the permanent regenerates. See rule <a href="#section-701-15">701.15</a>.
.rule{id: "section-614-9"}
  .rule_id 614.9.
  .rule_text Some effects replace damage dealt to one battle, creature, planeswalker, or player with the same damage dealt to another battle, creature, planeswalker, or player; such effects are called redirection effects. If one of those permanents is no longer on the battlefield when the damage would be redirected, or is no longer a battle, creature, or planeswalker when the damage would be redirected, the effect does nothing. If damage would be redirected to or from a player who has left the game, the effect does nothing.
.rule{id: "section-614-10"}
  .rule_id 614.10.
  .rule_text An effect that causes a player to skip an event, step, phase, or turn is a replacement effect. “Skip [something]” is the same as “Instead of doing [something], do nothing.” Once a step, phase, or turn has started, it can no longer be skipped—any skip effects will wait until the next occurrence.
.rule{id: "section-614-10a"}
  .rule_id 614.10a
  .rule_text Anything scheduled for a skipped step, phase, or turn won’t happen. Anything scheduled for the “next” occurrence of something waits for the first occurrence that isn’t skipped. If two effects each cause a player to skip their next occurrence, that player must skip the next two; one effect will be satisfied in skipping the first occurrence, while the other will remain until another occurrence can be skipped.
.rule{id: "section-614-10b"}
  .rule_id 614.10b
  .rule_text Some effects cause a player to skip a step, phase, or turn, then take another action. That action is considered to be the first thing that happens during the next step, phase, or turn to actually occur.
.rule{id: "section-614-11"}
  .rule_id 614.11.
  .rule_text Some effects replace card draws. These effects are applied even if no cards could be drawn because there are no cards in the affected player’s library.
.rule{id: "section-614-11a"}
  .rule_id 614.11a
  .rule_text If an effect replaces a draw within a sequence of card draws, all actions required by the replacement are completed, if possible, before resuming the sequence.
.rule{id: "section-614-11b"}
  .rule_id 614.11b
  .rule_text If an effect would have a player both draw a card and perform an additional action on that card, and the draw is replaced, the additional action is not performed on any cards that are drawn as a result of that replacement effect.
.rule{id: "section-614-12"}
  .rule_id 614.12.
  .rule_text Some replacement effects modify how a permanent enters the battlefield. (See rules <a href="#section-614-1c">614.1c</a>–d.) Such effects may come from the permanent itself if they affect only that permanent (as opposed to a general subset of permanents that includes it). They may also come from other sources. To determine which replacement effects apply and how they apply, check the characteristics of the permanent as it would exist on the battlefield, taking into account replacement effects that have already modified how it enters the battlefield (see rule <a href="#section-616-1">616.1</a>), continuous effects from the permanent’s own static abilities that would apply to it once it’s on the battlefield, and continuous effects that already exist and would apply to the permanent.
  .rule_text Example: Voice of All says “As Voice of All enters the battlefield, choose a color” and “Voice of All has protection from the chosen color.” An effect creates a token that’s a copy of Voice of All. As that token is created, the token’s controller chooses a color for it.
  .rule_text Example: Yixlid Jailer says “Cards in graveyards lose all abilities.” Scarwood Treefolk says “Scarwood Treefolk enters the battlefield tapped.” A Scarwood Treefolk that’s put onto the battlefield from a graveyard enters the battlefield tapped.
  .rule_text Example: Orb of Dreams is an artifact that says “Permanents enter the battlefield tapped.” It won’t affect itself, so Orb of Dreams enters the battlefield untapped.
.rule{id: "section-614-12a"}
  .rule_id 614.12a
  .rule_text If a replacement effect that modifies how a permanent enters the battlefield requires a choice, that choice is made before the permanent enters the battlefield.
.rule{id: "section-614-12b"}
  .rule_id 614.12b
  .rule_text Some replacement effects cause a permanent to enter the battlefield with its controller’s choice of one of two abilities, each marked with an anchor word and preceded by a bullet point. “[Anchor word] — [ability]” means “As long as [anchor word] was chosen as this permanent entered the battlefield, this permanent has [ability].” The abilities preceded by anchor words are each linked to the ability that causes a player to choose between them. See rule <a href="#section-607">607</a>, “Linked Abilities.”
.rule{id: "section-614-13"}
  .rule_id 614.13.
  .rule_text An effect that modifies how a permanent enters the battlefield may cause other objects to change zones.
.rule{id: "section-614-13a"}
  .rule_id 614.13a
  .rule_text While applying an effect that modifies how a permanent enters the battlefield, you may have to choose a number of objects that will also change zones. You can’t choose the object that will become that permanent or any other object entering the battlefield at the same time as that object.
  .rule_text Example: Sutured Ghoul says, in part, “As Sutured Ghoul enters the battlefield, exile any number of creature cards from your graveyard.” If Sutured Ghoul and Runeclaw Bear enter the battlefield from your graveyard at the same time, you can’t choose to exile either of them when applying Sutured Ghoul’s replacement effect.
.rule{id: "section-614-13b"}
  .rule_id 614.13b
  .rule_text The same object can’t be chosen to change zones more than once when applying replacement effects that modify how a single permanent enters the battlefield.
  .rule_text Example: Jund (a plane card) says, “Whenever a player casts a black, red, or green creature spell, it gains devour 5.” A player controls Runeclaw Bear and casts Thunder-Thrash Elder, a red creature spell with devour 3. As Thunder-Thrash Elder enters the battlefield, its controller can choose to sacrifice Runeclaw Bear when applying the devour 3 effect or when applying the devour 5 effect, but not both. Thunder-Thrash Elder will enter the battlefield with zero, three, or five +1/+1 counters, depending on this choice.
.rule{id: "section-614-14"}
  .rule_id 614.14.
  .rule_text An object may have one ability printed on it that generates a replacement effect which causes one or more cards to be exiled, and another ability that refers either to “the exiled cards” or to cards “exiled with [this object].” These abilities are linked: the second refers only to cards in the exile zone that were put there as a direct result of the replacement event caused by the first. If another object gains a pair of linked abilities, the abilities will be similarly linked on that object. They can’t be linked to any other ability, regardless of what other abilities the object may currently have or may have had in the past. See rule <a href="#section-607">607</a>, “Linked Abilities.”
.rule{id: "section-614-15"}
  .rule_id 614.15.
  .rule_text Some replacement effects are not continuous effects. Rather, they are an effect of a resolving spell or ability that replace part or all of that spell or ability’s own effect(s). Such effects are called self-replacement effects. The text creating a self-replacement effect is usually part of the ability whose effect is being replaced, but the text can be a separate ability, particularly when preceded by an ability word. When applying replacement effects to an event, self-replacement effects are applied before other replacement effects.
.rule{id: "section-614-16"}
  .rule_id 614.16.
  .rule_text Some replacement effects apply “if an effect would create one or more tokens” or “if an effect would put one or more counters on a permanent.” These replacement effects apply if the effect of a resolving spell or ability creates a token or puts a counter on a permanent, and they also apply if another replacement or prevention effect does so, even if the original event being modified wasn’t itself an effect. 
.rule{id: "section-614-17"}
  .rule_id 614.17.
  .rule_text Some effects state that something can’t happen. These effects aren’t replacement effects, but follow similar rules.
.rule{id: "section-614-17a"}
  .rule_id 614.17a
  .rule_text “Can’t” effects must exist before the appropriate event occurs—they can’t “go back in time” and change something that’s already happened.
.rule{id: "section-614-17b"}
  .rule_id 614.17b
  .rule_text If an event can’t happen, a player can’t choose to pay a cost that includes that event.
.rule{id: "section-614-17c"}
  .rule_id 614.17c
  .rule_text If an event can’t happen, it can only be replaced by a self-replacement effect (see rule <a href="#section-614-15">614.15</a>). Other replacement and/or prevention effects can’t modify or replace it.
.rule{id: "section-614-17d"}
  .rule_id 614.17d
  .rule_text Some “can’t” effects modify how a permanent enters the battlefield or whether it can enter the battlefield. Such effects may come from the permanent itself if they affect only that permanent (as opposed to a general subset of permanents that includes it). They may also come from other sources. To determine which “can’t” effects apply, check the characteristics of the permanent as it would exist on the battlefield, taking into account replacement effects that have already modified how it enters the battlefield (see rule <a href="#section-616-1">616.1</a>), continuous effects from the permanent’s own static abilities that would apply to it once it’s on the battlefield, and continuous effects that already exist and would apply to the permanent.

  .rule_id 615.
  .rule_text Prevention Effects
.rule{id: "section-615-1"}
  .rule_id 615.1.
  .rule_text Some continuous effects are prevention effects. Like replacement effects (see rule <a href="#section-614">614</a>), prevention effects apply continuously as events happen—they aren’t locked in ahead of time. Such effects watch for a damage event that would happen and completely or partially prevent the damage that would be dealt. They act like “shields” around whatever they’re affecting.
.rule{id: "section-615-1a"}
  .rule_id 615.1a
  .rule_text Effects that use the word “prevent” are prevention effects. Prevention effects use “prevent” to indicate what damage will not be dealt.
.rule{id: "section-615-2"}
  .rule_id 615.2.
  .rule_text Many prevention effects apply to damage from a source. See rule <a href="#section-609-7">609.7</a>.
.rule{id: "section-615-3"}
  .rule_id 615.3.
  .rule_text There are no special restrictions on casting a spell or activating an ability that generates a prevention effect. Such effects last until they’re used up or their duration has expired.
.rule{id: "section-615-4"}
  .rule_id 615.4.
  .rule_text Prevention effects must exist before the appropriate damage event occurs—they can’t “go back in time” and change something that’s already happened. Spells or abilities that generate these effects are often cast or activated in response to whatever would produce the event and thus resolve before that event would occur.
  .rule_text Example: A player can activate an ability that prevents damage in response to a spell that would deal damage. Once the spell resolves, though, it’s too late to prevent the damage.
.rule{id: "section-615-5"}
  .rule_id 615.5.
  .rule_text Some prevention effects also include an additional effect, which may refer to the amount of damage that was prevented. The prevention takes place at the time the original event would have happened; the rest of the effect takes place immediately afterward.
.rule{id: "section-615-6"}
  .rule_id 615.6.
  .rule_text If damage that would be dealt is prevented, it never happens. A modified event may occur instead, which may in turn trigger abilities. Note that the modified event may contain instructions that can’t be carried out, in which case the impossible instruction is simply ignored.
.rule{id: "section-615-7"}
  .rule_id 615.7.
  .rule_text Some prevention effects generated by the resolution of a spell or ability refer to a specific amount of damage—for example, “Prevent the next 3 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn.” These work like shields. Each 1 damage that would be dealt to the “shielded” permanent or player is prevented. Preventing 1 damage reduces the remaining shield by 1. If damage would be dealt to the shielded permanent or player by two or more applicable sources at the same time, the player or the controller of the permanent chooses which damage the shield prevents. Once the shield has been reduced to 0, any remaining damage is dealt normally. Such effects count only the amount of damage; the number of events or sources dealing it doesn’t matter.
.rule{id: "section-615-8"}
  .rule_id 615.8.
  .rule_text Some prevention effects generated by the resolution of a spell or ability refer to the next time a specific source would deal damage. These effects prevent the next instance of damage from that source, regardless of how much damage that is. Once an instance of damage from that source has been prevented, any subsequent instances of damage that would be dealt by that source are dealt normally.
.rule{id: "section-615-9"}
  .rule_id 615.9.
  .rule_text Some effects generated by the resolution of a spell or ability prevent damage from a source of a player’s choice with certain properties. When the source would deal damage, the shield rechecks the source’s properties. If the properties no longer match, the damage isn’t prevented or replaced and the shield isn’t used up. See rule <a href="#section-609-7b">609.7b</a>.
.rule{id: "section-615-10"}
  .rule_id 615.10.
  .rule_text Some prevention effects generated by static abilities refer to a specific amount of damage—for example, “If a source would deal damage to you, prevent 1 of that damage.” Such an effect prevents only the indicated amount of damage in any applicable damage event at any given time. It will apply separately to damage from other applicable events that would happen at the same time, or at a different time.
  .rule_text Example: Daunting Defender says “If a source would deal damage to a Cleric creature you control, prevent 1 of that damage.” Pyroclasm says “Pyroclasm deals 2 damage to each creature.” Pyroclasm will deal 1 damage to each Cleric creature controlled by Daunting Defender’s controller. It will deal 2 damage to each other creature.
.rule{id: "section-615-11"}
  .rule_id 615.11.
  .rule_text Some prevention effects prevent the next N damage that would be dealt to each of a number of untargeted creatures. Such an effect creates a prevention shield for each applicable creature when the spell or ability that generates that effect resolves.
  .rule_text Example: Wojek Apothecary has an ability that says “<span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-t"><span class="sr-only">{T}</span></span></span>: Prevent the next 1 damage that would be dealt to target creature and each other creature that shares a color with it this turn.” When the ability resolves, it gives the target creature and each other creature on the battlefield that shares a color with it at that time a shield preventing the next 1 damage that would be dealt to it. Changing creatures’ colors after the ability resolves doesn’t add or remove shields, and creatures that enter the battlefield later in the turn don’t get the shield.
.rule{id: "section-615-12"}
  .rule_id 615.12.
  .rule_text Some effects state that damage “can’t be prevented.” If unpreventable damage would be dealt, any applicable prevention effects are still applied to it. Those effects won’t prevent any damage, but any additional effects they have will take place. Existing damage prevention shields won’t be reduced by damage that can’t be prevented.
.rule{id: "section-615-12a"}
  .rule_id 615.12a
  .rule_text A prevention effect is applied to any particular unpreventable damage event just once. It won’t invoke itself repeatedly trying to prevent that damage.
.rule{id: "section-615-13"}
  .rule_id 615.13.
  .rule_text Some triggered abilities trigger when damage that would be dealt is prevented. Such an ability triggers each time a prevention effect is applied to one or more simultaneous damage events and prevents some or all of that damage.

  .rule_text Interaction of Replacement and/or Prevention Effects
.rule{id: "section-616-1"}
  .rule_id 616.1.
  .rule_text If two or more replacement and/or prevention effects are attempting to modify the way an event affects an object or player, the affected object’s controller (or its owner if it has no controller) or the affected player chooses one to apply, following the steps listed below. If two or more players have to make these choices at the same time, choices are made in APNAP order (see rule <a href="#section-101-4">101.4</a>).
.rule{id: "section-616-1a"}
  .rule_id 616.1a
  .rule_text If any of the replacement and/or prevention effects are self-replacement effects (see rule <a href="#section-614-15">614.15</a>), one of them must be chosen. If not, proceed to rule <a href="#section-616-1b">616.1b</a>.
.rule{id: "section-616-1b"}
  .rule_id 616.1b
  .rule_text If any of the replacement and/or prevention effects would modify under whose control an object would enter the battlefield, one of them must be chosen. If not, proceed to rule <a href="#section-616-1c">616.1c</a>.
.rule{id: "section-616-1c"}
  .rule_id 616.1c
  .rule_text If any of the replacement and/or prevention effects would cause an object to become a copy of another object as it enters the battlefield, one of them must be chosen. If not, proceed to rule <a href="#section-616-1d">616.1d</a>.
.rule{id: "section-616-1d"}
  .rule_id 616.1d
  .rule_text If any of the replacement and/or prevention effects would cause a card to enter the battlefield with its back face up, one of them must be chosen (See rule <a href="#section-701-28">701.28</a>, “Transform,” and rule <a href="#section-701-50">701.50</a>, “Convert.”). If not, proceed to <a href="#section-616-1e">616.1e</a>.
.rule{id: "section-616-1e"}
  .rule_id 616.1e
  .rule_text Any of the applicable replacement and/or prevention effects may be chosen.
.rule{id: "section-616-1f"}
  .rule_id 616.1f
  .rule_text Once the chosen effect has been applied, this process is repeated (taking into account only replacement or prevention effects that would now be applicable) until there are no more left to apply.
  .rule_text Example: Two permanents are on the battlefield. One is an enchantment that reads “If a card would be put into a graveyard from anywhere, instead exile it,” and the other is a creature that reads “If [this creature] would die, instead shuffle it into its owner’s library.” If the creature is destroyed, its controller decides which replacement to apply first; the other does nothing.
  .rule_text Example: Essence of the Wild reads “Creatures you control enter the battlefield as a copy of Essence of the Wild.” A player who controls Essence of the Wild casts Rusted Sentinel, which normally enters the battlefield tapped. As it enters the battlefield, the copy effect from Essence of the Wild is applied first. As a result, it no longer has the ability that causes it to enter the battlefield tapped. Rusted Sentinel will enter the battlefield as an untapped copy of Essence of the Wild.
.rule{id: "section-616-1g"}
  .rule_id 616.1g
  .rule_text While following the steps in <a href="#section-616-1a">616.1a</a>–f, one replacement or prevention effect may apply to an event, and another may apply to an event contained within the first event. In this case, the second effect can’t be chosen until after the first effect has been chosen.
  .rule_text Example: A player is instructed to create a token that’s a copy of Voice of All, which has the ability “As Voice of All enters the battlefield, choose a color.” Doubling Season has an ability that reads “If an effect would create one or more tokens under your control, it creates twice that many of those tokens instead.” Because entering the battlefield is an event contained within the event of creating a token, the effect of Doubling Season must be applied first, and then the effects of the two Voice of All tokens may be applied in either order.
.rule{id: "section-616-2"}
  .rule_id 616.2.
  .rule_text A replacement or prevention effect can become applicable to an event as the result of another replacement or prevention effect that modifies the event.
  .rule_text Example: One effect reads “If you would gain life, draw that many cards instead,” and another reads “If you would draw a card, return a card from your graveyard to your hand instead.” Both effects combine (regardless of the order they came into existence): Instead of gaining 1 life, the player puts a card from their graveyard into their hand.

  .rule_id 700.
  .rule_text General
.rule{id: "section-700-1"}
  .rule_id 700.1.
  .rule_text Anything that happens in a game is an event. Multiple events may take place during the resolution of a spell or ability. The text of triggered abilities and replacement effects defines the event they’re looking for. One “happening” may be treated as a single event by one ability and as multiple events by another.
  .rule_text Example: If an attacking creature is blocked by two creatures, this is one event for a triggered ability that reads “Whenever [this creature] becomes blocked” but two events for a triggered ability that reads “Whenever [this creature] becomes blocked by a creature.”
.rule{id: "section-700-2"}
  .rule_id 700.2.
  .rule_text A spell or ability is modal if it has two or more options in a bulleted list preceded by instructions for a player to choose a number of those options, such as “Choose one —.” Each of those options is a mode. Modal cards printed prior to the Khans of Tarkir® set didn’t use bulleted lists for the modes; these cards have received errata in the Oracle card reference so the modes do appear in a bulleted list.
.rule{id: "section-700-2a"}
  .rule_id 700.2a
  .rule_text The controller of a modal spell or activated ability chooses the mode(s) as part of casting that spell or activating that ability. If one of the modes would be illegal (due to an inability to choose legal targets, for example), that mode can’t be chosen. (See rule <a href="#section-601-2b">601.2b</a>.)
.rule{id: "section-700-2b"}
  .rule_id 700.2b
  .rule_text The controller of a modal triggered ability chooses the mode(s) as part of putting that ability on the stack. If one of the modes would be illegal (due to an inability to choose legal targets, for example), that mode can’t be chosen. If no mode is chosen, the ability is removed from the stack. (See rule <a href="#section-603-3c">603.3c</a>.)
.rule{id: "section-700-2c"}
  .rule_id 700.2c
  .rule_text If a spell or ability targets one or more targets only if a particular mode is chosen for it, its controller will need to choose those targets only if they chose that mode. Otherwise, the spell or ability is treated as though it did not have those targets. (See rule <a href="#section-601-2c">601.2c</a>.)
.rule{id: "section-700-2d"}
  .rule_id 700.2d
  .rule_text If a player is allowed to choose more than one mode for a modal spell or ability, that player normally can’t choose the same mode more than once. However, some modal spells include the instruction “You may choose the same mode more than once.” If a particular mode is chosen multiple times, the spell is treated as if that mode appeared that many times in sequence. If that mode requires a target, the same player or object may be chosen as the target for each of those modes, or different targets may be chosen.
.rule{id: "section-700-2e"}
  .rule_id 700.2e
  .rule_text Some spells and abilities specify that a player other than their controller chooses a mode for it. In that case, the other player does so when the spell or ability’s controller normally would do so. If there is more than one other player who could make such a choice, the spell or ability’s controller decides which of those players will make the choice.
.rule{id: "section-700-2f"}
  .rule_id 700.2f
  .rule_text Modal spells and abilities may have different targeting requirements for each mode. Changing a spell or ability’s target can’t change its mode.
.rule{id: "section-700-2g"}
  .rule_id 700.2g
  .rule_text A copy of a modal spell or ability copies the mode(s) chosen for it. The controller of the copy can’t choose a different mode. (See rule <a href="#section-707-10">707.10</a>.)
.rule{id: "section-700-3"}

  .rule_text Each of the affected objects must be put into exactly one of those piles, unless the effect specifies otherwise.
.rule{id: "section-700-3b"}
  .rule_id 700.3b
  .rule_text Each object in a pile is still an individual object. The pile is not an object.
.rule{id: "section-700-3c"}
  .rule_id 700.3c
  .rule_text Objects grouped into piles don’t leave the zone they’re currently in. If cards in a graveyard are split into piles, the order of the graveyard must be maintained.
  .rule_text Example: Fact or Fiction reads, “Reveal the top five cards of your library. An opponent separates those cards into two piles. Put one pile into your hand and the other into your graveyard.” While an opponent is separating the revealed cards into piles, they’re still in their owner’s library. They don’t leave the library until they’re put into their owner’s hand or graveyard.

.rule{id: "section-700-5"}
  .rule_id 700.5.
  .rule_text A player’s devotion to [color] is equal to the number of mana symbols of that color among the mana costs of permanents that player controls. A player’s devotion to [color 1] and [color 2] is equal to the number of mana symbols among the mana costs of permanents that player controls that are [color 1], [color 2], or both colors.
.rule{id: "section-700-5a"}
  .rule_id 700.5a
  .rule_text A player’s devotion to each color and combination of colors, taking into account any effects that modify devotion, is calculated after considering any copy, control, or text-changing effects but before any other effects that modify the characteristics of permanents. This is an exception to <a href="#section-613-10">613.10</a>. See also rule <a href="#section-613">613</a>, “Interaction of Continuous Effects.”
  .rule_text Example: Altar of the Pantheon is an artifact with no colored mana in its cost and an ability that says “Your devotion to each color and each combination of colors is increased by one.” Purphoros, God of the Forge is a permanent mana cost <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-3"><span class="sr-only">{3}</span></span><span class="mana mana-cost mana-r"><span class="sr-only">{R}</span></span></span> and an ability that says “As long as your devotion to red is less than five, Purphoros isn’t a creature.” If a player controls both of these permanents and another permanent that costs <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-r"><span class="sr-only">{R}</span></span><span class="mana mana-cost mana-r"><span class="sr-only">{R}</span></span><span class="mana mana-cost mana-r"><span class="sr-only">{R}</span></span></span>, that player’s devotion to red is calculated to be five before Purphoros’s type-changing effect is applied, and Purphoros is a creature.
.rule{id: "section-700-6"}

  .rule_text If an ability uses a phrase such as “this [something]” to identify an object, where [something] is a characteristic, it is referring to that particular object, even if it isn’t the appropriate characteristic at the time.
  .rule_text Example: An ability reads “Target creature gets +2/+2 until end of turn. Destroy that creature at the beginning of the next end step.” The ability will destroy the object it gave +2/+2 to even if that object isn’t a creature at the beginning of the next end step.
.rule{id: "section-700-8"}
  .rule_id 700.8.
  .rule_text Some cards refer to a player’s party. A player’s party consists of up to one Cleric creature that player controls, up to one Rogue creature they control, up to one Warrior creature they control, and up to one Wizard creature they control.
.rule{id: "section-700-8a"}
  .rule_id 700.8a
  .rule_text If a spell, ability, or effect needs to determine the number of creatures in a player’s party, the calculation of that number is performed automatically by the game and results in a number between zero and four. Players don’t declare which specific creatures they control are in their party for such an effect.
.rule{id: "section-700-8b"}
  .rule_id 700.8b
  .rule_text If a creature has multiple creature types for which it could be the party member, it is counted as the party member for only one of those types. If there are different ways to count such a creature that results in different numbers of creatures in a player’s party, it is counted in such a way to get the highest result.
.rule{id: "section-700-8c"}

  .rule_text A player has a full party if there are four creatures in that player’s party.
.rule{id: "section-700-8d"}
  .rule_id 700.8d
  .rule_text One card, Stick Together, instructs players to choose a party from among creatures they control. To do so, for each of the creature types listed in rule <a href="#section-700-8">700.8</a>, each player chooses up to one creature they control of that type.
.rule{id: "section-700-9"}
  .rule_id 700.9.
  .rule_text Some cards refer to modified creatures. A creature is modified if it has one or more counters on it (see rule <a href="#section-122">122</a>), if it is equipped (see rule <a href="#section-301-5">301.5</a>), or if it is enchanted by an Aura that is controlled by that creature’s controller. (see rule <a href="#section-303-4">303.4</a>). If an ability of a permanent checks to see whether that permanent is modified, the answer is always no if that permanent isn’t a currently a creature.
.rule{id: "section-700-10"}
  .rule_id 700.10.
  .rule_text Some effects refer to a permanent “that was activated this turn.” This means that the permanent was the source of an ability that was activated this turn, regardless of whether that permanent still has that activated ability or the player who activated it is still in the game.

  .rule_text To activate an activated ability is to put it onto the stack and pay its costs, so that it will eventually resolve and have its effect. Only an object’s controller (or its owner, if it doesn’t have a controller) can activate its activated ability unless the object specifically says otherwise. A player may activate an ability if they have priority. See rule <a href="#section-602">602</a>, “Activating Activated Abilities.”

.rule{id: "section-701-3a"}
  .rule_id 701.3a
  .rule_text To attach an Aura, Equipment, or Fortification to an object or player means to take it from where it currently is and put it onto that object or player. If something is attached to a permanent on the battlefield, it’s customary to place it so that it’s physically touching the permanent. An Aura, Equipment, or Fortification can’t be attached to an object or player it couldn’t enchant, equip, or fortify, respectively.
.rule{id: "section-701-3b"}
  .rule_id 701.3b
  .rule_text If an effect tries to attach an Aura, Equipment, or Fortification to an object or player it can’t be attached to, the Aura, Equipment, or Fortification doesn’t move. If an effect tries to attach an Aura, Equipment, or Fortification to the object or player it’s already attached to, the effect does nothing. If an effect tries to attach an object that isn’t an Aura, Equipment, or Fortification to another object or player, the effect does nothing and the first object doesn’t move.
.rule{id: "section-701-3c"}

  .rule_id 701.3d
  .rule_text To “unattach” an Equipment from a creature means to move it away from that creature so the Equipment is on the battlefield but is not equipping anything. It should no longer be physically touching any creature. If an Aura, Equipment, or Fortification that was attached to an object or player ceases to be attached to it, that counts as “becoming unattached [from that object or player]”; this includes if that Aura, Equipment, or Fortification leaves the battlefield, the object leaves the zone it was in, or that player leaves the game.

  .rule_id 701.10g
  .rule_text A spell or ability may instruct a player to exchange two numerical values. In such an exchange, each value becomes equal to the previous value of the other. If either of those values is a life total, the affected player gains or loses the amount of life necessary to equal the other value. Replacement effects may modify this gain or loss, and triggered abilities may trigger on it. A player who can’t gain life can’t be given a higher life total this way, and a player who can’t lose life can’t be given a lower life total this way (see rules <a href="#section-119-7">119.7</a>–8). If either of those values is a power or toughness, a continuous effect is created setting that power or toughness to the other value (see rule <a href="#section-613-4b">613.4b</a>).

  .rule_text If an ability checks information about a single milled card but more than one card was milled, that ability refers to each of the milled cards. If that ability asks for any information about the milled card, such as a characteristic or mana value, it gets multiple answers. If these answers are used to determine the value of a variable, the sum of the answers is used. If that ability performs any actions on “the” card, it performs that action on each milled card.

A player may play a land if they have priority, it’s the main phase of their turn, the stack is empty, and they haven’t played a land this turn. Playing a land is a special action (see rule <a href="#section-116">116</a>), so it doesn’t use the stack; it simply happens.

  .rule_text If the effect of a resolving spell or ability regenerates a permanent, it creates a replacement effect that protects the permanent the next time it would be destroyed this turn. In this case, “Regenerate [permanent]” means “The next time [permanent] would be destroyed this turn, instead remove all damage marked on it and tap it. If it’s an attacking or blocking creature, remove it from combat.”
.rule{id: "section-701-15b"}
  .rule_id 701.15b

If an effect causes a card to be revealed, it remains revealed for as long as necessary to complete the parts of the effect that card is relevant to. If the cost to cast a spell or activate an ability includes revealing a card, the card remains revealed from the time the spell or ability is announced until the time it leaves the stack. If revealing a card causes a triggered ability to trigger, the card remains revealed until that triggered ability leaves the stack.

  .rule_text Example: Splinter says “Exile target artifact. Search its controller’s graveyard, hand, and library for all cards with the same name as that artifact and exile them. Then that player shuffles their library.” A player casts Splinter targeting Howling Mine (an artifact). Howling Mine’s controller has another Howling Mine in her graveyard and two more in her library.

  .rule_text Some effects cause a player to search a library for a card or cards, shuffle that library, then put some or all of the found cards into a different zone or in a certain position in that library. In such cases, the found cards aren’t included in the shuffle, even though they remain in the library at that time. Rather, all the cards in that library except those are shuffled.

.rule{id: "section-701-20c"}
  .rule_id 701.20c
  .rule_text If an effect would cause a player to shuffle one or more specific objects into a library, that library is shuffled even if none of those objects are in the zone they’re expected to be in or an effect causes all of those objects to be moved to another zone or remain in their current zone.
  .rule_text Example: Guile says, in part, “When Guile is put into a graveyard from anywhere, shuffle it into its owner’s library.” It’s put into a graveyard and its ability triggers, then a player exiles it from that graveyard in response. When the ability resolves, the library is shuffled.
  .rule_text Example: Black Sun’s Zenith says, in part, “Shuffle Black Sun’s Zenith into its owner’s library.” Black Sun’s Zenith is in a graveyard, has gained flashback (due to Recoup, perhaps), and is cast from that graveyard. Black Sun’s Zenith will be exiled, and its owner’s library will be shuffled.

  .rule_id 701.20g
  .rule_text If an effect would cause a player to shuffle a library at the same time that an object would be put into a certain position in that library, the result is a shuffled library that’s randomized except that the object is in the specified position.
  .rule_text Example: Darksteel Colossus and Gravebane Zombie are put into a player’s graveyard from the battlefield at the same time. Darksteel Colossus says in part “If Darksteel Colossus would be put into a graveyard from anywhere, reveal Darksteel Colossus and shuffle it into its owner’s library instead.” Gravebane Zombie says “If Gravebane Zombie would die, put Gravebane Zombie on top of its owner’s library instead.” The player shuffles Darksteel Colossus into their library and puts Gravebane Zombie on top of that library.

  .rule_id 701.31b
  .rule_text Monstrous is a designation that has no rules meaning other than to act as a marker that the monstrosity action and other spells and abilities can identify.

  .rule_text Any time you have priority, you may turn a manifested permanent you control face up. This is a special action that doesn’t use the stack (see rule <a href="#section-116-2b">116.2b</a>). To do this, show all players that the card representing that permanent is a creature card and what that card’s mana cost is, pay that cost, then turn the permanent face up. The effect defining its characteristics while it was face down ends, and it regains its normal characteristics. (If the card representing that permanent isn’t a creature card or it doesn’t have a mana cost, it can’t be turned face up this way.)

  .rule_id 701.50d
  .rule_text If a spell or ability instructs a player to convert a permanent, and the face that permanent would convert into is represented by an instant or sorcery card face, or is a transforming token that was created with an instant or sorcery face, nothing happens.
.rule{id: "section-701-50e"}
  .rule_id 701.50e
  .rule_text If an activated or triggered ability of a permanent that isn’t a delayed triggered ability of that permanent tries to convert it, the permanent does so only if it hasn’t converted or transformed since the ability was put onto the stack. If a delayed triggered ability of a permanent tries to convert that permanent, the permanent does so only if it hasn’t converted or transformed since that delayed triggered ability was created. In both cases, if the permanent has already transformed or converted, an instruction to do either is ignored.

  .rule_id 702.1.
  .rule_text Most abilities describe exactly what they do in the card’s rules text. Some, though, are very common or would require too much space to define on the card. In these cases, the object lists only the name of the ability as a “keyword”; sometimes reminder text summarizes the game rule.
.rule{id: "section-702-1a"}
  .rule_id 702.1a
  .rule_text If an effect refers to a “[keyword ability] cost,” it refers only to the variable costs for that keyword.
  .rule_text Example: Varolz, the Scar-Striped has an ability that says “Each creature card in your graveyard has scavenge. The scavenge cost is equal to its mana cost.” A creature card’s scavenge cost is an amount of mana equal to its mana cost, and the activation cost of the scavenge ability is that amount of mana plus “Exile this card from your graveyard.”
.rule{id: "section-702-1b"}
  .rule_id 702.1b
  .rule_text An effect that grants an object a keyword ability may define a variable in that ability based on characteristics of that object or other information about the game state. For these abilities, the value of that variable is constantly reevaluated.
  .rule_text Example: Volcano Hellion has the ability “Volcano Hellion has echo <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-x"><span class="sr-only">{X}</span></span></span>, where X is your life total.” If your life total is 10 when Volcano Hellion’s echo ability triggers but 5 when it resolves, the echo cost to pay is <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-5"><span class="sr-only">{5}</span></span></span>.
  .rule_text Example: Fire//Ice is a split card whose halves have the mana costs <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-1"><span class="sr-only">{1}</span></span><span class="mana mana-cost mana-r"><span class="sr-only">{R}</span></span></span> and <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-1"><span class="sr-only">{1}</span></span><span class="mana mana-cost mana-u"><span class="sr-only">{U}</span></span></span>. Past in Flames reads “Each instant and sorcery card in your graveyard gains flashback until end of turn. The flashback cost is equal to its mana cost.” Fire//Ice has “Flashback <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-2"><span class="sr-only">{2}</span></span><span class="mana mana-cost mana-u"><span class="sr-only">{U}</span></span><span class="mana mana-cost mana-r"><span class="sr-only">{R}</span></span></span>” while it is in your graveyard, but if you choose to cast Fire, the resulting spell has “Flashback <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-1"><span class="sr-only">{1}</span></span><span class="mana mana-cost mana-r"><span class="sr-only">{R}</span></span></span>.”
.rule{id: "section-702-1c"}
  .rule_id 702.1c
  .rule_text An effect may state that “the same is true for” a list of keyword abilities or similar. If one of those keyword abilities has variants or variables and the effect grants that keyword or counters of that keyword to one or more objects and/or players, it grants each appropriate variant and variable of that keyword.
  .rule_text Example: Concerted Effort is an enchantment that reads “At the beginning of each upkeep, creatures you control gain flying until end of turn if a creature you control has flying. The same is true for fear, first strike, double strike, landwalk, protection, trample, and vigilance.” As that triggered ability resolves, each landwalk and protection ability from among creatures you control is granted to each creature you control.
.rule{id: "section-702-1d"}
  .rule_id 702.1d

  .rule_text “Protection from [quality A] and from [quality B]” is shorthand for “protection from [quality A]” and “protection from [quality B]”; it behaves as two separate protection abilities.

Such a permanent or player can’t be targeted by spells or abilities the specified player controls and can’t be enchanted by Auras that player controls. Such a permanent can’t be equipped by Equipment that player controls, fortified by Fortifications that player controls, or blocked by creatures that player controls.

  .rule_text Some Auras both give the enchanted creature protection from a quality and say “this effect doesn’t remove” either that specific Aura or all Auras. This means that the specified Auras aren’t put into their owners’ graveyards as a state-based action.

.rule{id: "section-702-19a"}
  .rule_id 702.19a
  .rule_text Trample is a static ability that modifies the rules for assigning an attacking creature’s combat damage. The ability has no effect when a creature with trample is blocking or is dealing noncombat damage. (See rule <a href="#section-510">510</a>, “Combat Damage Step.”)
.rule{id: "section-702-19b"}
  .rule_id 702.19b
  .rule_text The controller of an attacking creature with trample first assigns damage to the creature(s) blocking it. Once all those blocking creatures are assigned lethal damage, any excess damage is assigned as its controller chooses among those blocking creatures and the player, planeswalker, or battle the creature is attacking. When checking for assigned lethal damage, take into account damage already marked on the creature and damage from other creatures that’s being assigned during the same combat damage step, but not any abilities or effects that might change the amount of damage that’s actually dealt. The attacking creature’s controller need not assign lethal damage to all those blocking creatures but in that case can’t assign any damage to the player or planeswalker it’s attacking.
  .rule_text Example: A 2/2 creature that can block an additional creature blocks two attackers: a 1/1 with no abilities and a 3/3 with trample. The active player could assign 1 damage from the first attacker and 1 damage from the second to the blocking creature, and 2 damage to the defending player from the creature with trample.
  .rule_text Example: A 6/6 green creature with trample is blocked by a 2/2 creature with protection from green. The attacking creature’s controller must assign at least 2 damage to the blocker, even though that damage will be prevented by the blocker’s protection ability. The attacking creature’s controller can divide the rest of the damage as they choose between the blocking creature and the defending player.
.rule{id: "section-702-19c"}
  .rule_id 702.19c
  .rule_text Trample over planeswalkers is a variant of trample that modifies the rules for assigning combat damage to planeswalkers. The controller of a creature with trample over planeswalkers assigns that creature’s combat damage as described in rule <a href="#section-702-19b">702.19b</a>, with one exception. If that creature is attacking a planeswalker, after lethal damage is assigned to all blocking creatures and damage at least equal to the loyalty of the planeswalker the creature is attacking is assigned to that planeswalker, further excess damage may be assigned as the attacking creature’s controller chooses among those blocking creatures, that planeswalker, and that planeswalker’s controller. When checking for assigned damage equal to a planeswalker’s loyalty, take into account damage from other creatures that’s being assigned during the same combat damage step, but not any abilities or effects that might change the amount of damage that’s actually dealt.
  .rule_text Example: A player controls a planeswalker with three loyalty counters that is being attacked by a 1/1 with no abilities and a 7/7 with trample over planeswalkers. The active player could assign 1 damage from the first attacker and 2 damage from the second to the planeswalker and 5 damage to the defending player from the creature with trample over planeswalkers.

  .rule_id 702.19d

  .rule_text As a player declares attackers, they may declare that one or more attacking creatures with banding and up to one attacking creature without banding (even if it has “bands with other”) are all in a “band.” They may also declare that one or more attacking [quality] creatures with “bands with other [quality]” and any number of other attacking [quality] creatures are all in a band. A player may declare as many attacking bands as they want, but each creature may be a member of only one of them.

  .rule_id 702.22h
  .rule_text If an attacking creature becomes blocked by a creature, each other creature in the same band as the attacking creature becomes blocked by that same blocking creature.
  .rule_text Example: A player attacks with a band consisting of a creature with flying and a creature with swampwalk. The defending player, who controls a Swamp, can block the flying creature if able. If they do, then the creature with swampwalk will also become blocked by the blocking creature(s).

  .rule_text Cumulative Upkeep
.rule{id: "section-702-24a"}
  .rule_id 702.24a
  .rule_text Cumulative upkeep is a triggered ability that imposes an increasing cost on a permanent. “Cumulative upkeep [cost]” means “At the beginning of your upkeep, if this permanent is on the battlefield, put an age counter on this permanent. Then you may pay [cost] for each age counter on it. If you don’t, sacrifice it.” If [cost] has choices associated with it, each choice is made separately for each age counter, then either the entire set of costs is paid, or none of them is paid. Partial payments aren’t allowed.
  .rule_text Example: A creature has “Cumulative upkeep <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-w"><span class="sr-only">{W}</span></span></span> or <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-u"><span class="sr-only">{U}</span></span></span>” and two age counters on it. When its ability next triggers and resolves, the creature’s controller puts an age counter on it and then may pay <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-w"><span class="sr-only">{W}</span></span><span class="mana mana-cost mana-w"><span class="sr-only">{W}</span></span><span class="mana mana-cost mana-w"><span class="sr-only">{W}</span></span></span>, <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-w"><span class="sr-only">{W}</span></span><span class="mana mana-cost mana-w"><span class="sr-only">{W}</span></span><span class="mana mana-cost mana-u"><span class="sr-only">{U}</span></span></span>, <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-w"><span class="sr-only">{W}</span></span><span class="mana mana-cost mana-u"><span class="sr-only">{U}</span></span><span class="mana mana-cost mana-u"><span class="sr-only">{U}</span></span></span>, or <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-u"><span class="sr-only">{U}</span></span><span class="mana mana-cost mana-u"><span class="sr-only">{U}</span></span><span class="mana mana-cost mana-u"><span class="sr-only">{U}</span></span></span> to keep the creature on the battlefield.
  .rule_text Example: A creature has “Cumulative upkeep—Sacrifice a creature” and one age counter on it. When its ability next triggers and resolves, its controller can’t choose the same creature to sacrifice twice. Either two different creatures must be sacrificed, or the creature with cumulative upkeep must be sacrificed.
.rule{id: "section-702-24b"}
  .rule_id 702.24b
  .rule_text If a permanent has multiple instances of cumulative upkeep, each triggers separately. However, the age counters are not connected to any particular ability; each cumulative upkeep ability will count the total number of age counters on the permanent at the time that ability resolves.
  .rule_text Example: A creature has two instances of “Cumulative upkeep—Pay 1 life.” The creature has no age counters, and both cumulative upkeep abilities trigger. When the first ability resolves, the controller adds a counter and then chooses to pay 1 life. When the second ability resolves, the controller adds another counter and then chooses to pay an additional 2 life.

  .rule_text Phasing
.rule{id: "section-702-26a"}
  .rule_id 702.26a
  .rule_text Phasing is a static ability that modifies the rules of the untap step. During each player’s untap step, before the active player untaps permanents, all phased-in permanents with phasing that player controls “phase out.” Simultaneously, all phased-out permanents that had phased out under that player’s control “phase in.”
.rule{id: "section-702-26b"}
  .rule_id 702.26b
  .rule_text If a permanent phases out, its status changes to “phased out.” Except for rules and effects that specifically mention phased-out permanents, a phased-out permanent is treated as though it does not exist. It can’t affect or be affected by anything else in the game. A permanent that phases out is removed from combat. (See rule <a href="#section-506-4">506.4</a>.)
  .rule_text Example: You control three creatures, one of which is phased out. You cast a spell that says “Draw a card for each creature you control.” You draw two cards.
  .rule_text Example: You control a phased-out creature. You cast a spell that says “Destroy all creatures.” The phased-out creature is not destroyed.
.rule{id: "section-702-26c"}
  .rule_id 702.26c

.rule{id: "section-702-26d"}
  .rule_id 702.26d
  .rule_text The phasing event doesn’t actually cause a permanent to change zones or control, even though it’s treated as though it’s not on the battlefield and not under its controller’s control while it’s phased out. Zone-change triggers don’t trigger when a permanent phases in or out. Tokens continue to exist on the battlefield while phased out. Counters and stickers remain on a permanent while it’s phased out. Effects that check a phased-in permanent’s history won’t treat the phasing event as having caused the permanent to leave or enter the battlefield or its controller’s control.
.rule{id: "section-702-26e"}
  .rule_id 702.26e
  .rule_text If a continuous effect generated by the resolution of a spell or ability modifies the characteristics or changes the controller of any objects, a phased-out permanent won’t be included in the set of affected objects. This includes continuous effects that reference the permanent specifically, unless they also specifically refer to the permanent as phased out.
.rule{id: "section-702-26f"}
  .rule_id 702.26f
  .rule_text Continuous effects that affect a phased-out permanent may expire while that permanent is phased out. If so, they will no longer affect that permanent once it’s phased in. In particular, effects with “for as long as” durations that track that permanent (see rule <a href="#section-611-2b">611.2b</a>) end when that permanent phases out because they can no longer see it.
.rule{id: "section-702-26g"}
  .rule_id 702.26g
  .rule_text When a permanent phases out, any Auras, Equipment, or Fortifications attached to that permanent phase out at the same time. This alternate way of phasing out is known as phasing out “indirectly.” An Aura, Equipment, or Fortification that phased out indirectly won’t phase in by itself, but instead phases in along with the permanent it’s attached to.

Therefore objects with cycling will be affected by effects that depend on objects having one or more activated abilities.
.rule{id: "section-702-29c"}
  .rule_id 702.29c
  .rule_text Some cards with cycling have abilities that trigger when they’re cycled. “When you cycle [this card]” means “When you discard [this card] to pay an activation cost of a cycling ability.” These abilities trigger from whatever zone the card winds up in after it’s cycled.

  .rule_text Typecycling is a variant of the cycling ability. “[Type]cycling [cost]” means “[Cost], Discard this card: Search your library for a [type] card, reveal it, and put it into your hand. Then shuffle your library.” This type is usually a subtype (as in “mountaincycling”) but can be any card type, subtype, supertype, or combination thereof (as in “basic landcycling”).
.rule{id: "section-702-29f"}
  .rule_id 702.29f
  .rule_text Typecycling abilities are cycling abilities, and typecycling costs are cycling costs. Any cards that trigger when a player cycles a card will trigger when a card is discarded to pay an activation cost of a typecycling ability. Any effect that stops players from cycling cards will stop players from activating cards’ typecycling abilities. Any effect that increases or reduces a cycling cost will increase or reduce a typecycling cost. Any effect that looks for a card with cycling will find a card with typecycling.

  .rule_text Madness is a keyword that represents two abilities. The first is a static ability that functions while the card with madness is in a player’s hand. The second is a triggered ability that functions when the first ability is applied. “Madness [cost]” means “If a player would discard this card, that player discards it, but exiles it instead of putting it into their graveyard” and “When this card is exiled this way, its owner may cast it by paying [cost] rather than paying its mana cost. If that player doesn’t, they put this card into their graveyard.”

.rule{id: "section-702-37c"}
  .rule_id 702.37c
  .rule_text To cast a card using its morph ability, turn it face down. It becomes a 2/2 face-down creature card with no text, no name, no subtypes, and no mana cost. Any effects or prohibitions that would apply to casting a card with these characteristics (and not the face-up card’s characteristics) are applied to casting this card. These values are the copiable values of that object’s characteristics. (See rule <a href="#section-613">613</a>, “Interaction of Continuous Effects,” and rule <a href="#section-707">707</a>, “Copying Objects.”) Put it onto the stack (as a face-down spell with the same characteristics), and pay <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-3"><span class="sr-only">{3}</span></span></span> rather than pay its mana cost. This follows the rules for paying alternative costs. You can use a morph ability to cast a card from any zone from which you could normally play it. When the spell resolves, it enters the battlefield with the same characteristics the spell had. The morph effect applies to the face-down object wherever it is, and it ends when the permanent is turned face up.
.rule{id: "section-702-37d"}
  .rule_id 702.37d
  .rule_text You can’t normally cast a card face down. A morph ability allows you to do so.

  .rule_id 702.37e
  .rule_text Any time you have priority, you may turn a face-down permanent you control with a morph ability face up. This is a special action; it doesn’t use the stack (see rule <a href="#section-116">116</a>). To do this, show all players what the permanent’s morph cost would be if it were face up, pay that cost, then turn the permanent face up. (If the permanent wouldn’t have a morph cost if it were face up, it can’t be turned face up this way.) The morph effect on it ends, and it regains its normal characteristics. Any abilities relating to the permanent entering the battlefield don’t trigger when it’s turned face up and don’t have any effect, because the permanent has already entered the battlefield.

Otherwise, it enters the battlefield with a charge counter on it for each color of mana spent to cast it.”
.rule{id: "section-702-44b"}

  .rule_text Splice
.rule{id: "section-702-47a"}
  .rule_id 702.47a
  .rule_text Splice is a static ability that functions while a card is in your hand. “Splice onto [quality] [cost]” means “You may reveal this card from your hand as you cast a [quality] spell. If you do, that spell gains the text of this card’s rules text and you pay [cost] as an additional cost to cast that spell.” Paying a card’s splice cost follows the rules for paying additional costs in rules <a href="#section-601-2b">601.2b</a> and <a href="#section-601-2f">601.2f</a>–h.
  .rule_text Example: Since the card with splice remains in the player’s hand, it can later be cast normally or spliced onto another spell. It can even be discarded to pay a “discard a card” cost of the spell it’s spliced onto.
.rule{id: "section-702-47b"}
  .rule_id 702.47b
  .rule_text You can’t choose to use a splice ability if you can’t make the required choices (targets, etc.) for that card’s rules text. You can’t splice any one card onto the same spell more than once. If you’re splicing more than one card onto a spell, reveal them all at once and choose the order in which their effects will happen. The effects of the main spell must happen first.
.rule{id: "section-702-47c"}
  .rule_id 702.47c
  .rule_text The spell has the characteristics of the main spell, plus the rules text of each of the spliced cards. This is a text-changing effect (see rule <a href="#section-612">612</a>, “Text-Changing Effects”). The spell doesn’t gain any other characteristics (name, mana cost, color, supertypes, card types, subtypes, etc.) of the spliced cards. Text gained by the spell that refers to a card by name refers to the spell on the stack, not the card from which the text was copied.
  .rule_text Example: Glacial Ray is a red card with splice onto Arcane that reads, “Glacial Ray deals 2 damage to any target.” Suppose Glacial Ray is spliced onto Reach Through Mists, a blue spell. The spell is still blue, and Reach Through Mists deals the damage. This means that the ability can target a creature with protection from red and deal 2 damage to that creature.

.rule{id: "section-702-48c"}
  .rule_id 702.48c
  .rule_text Generic mana in the sacrificed permanent’s mana cost reduces generic mana in the spell’s total cost.

(See rule <a href="#section-103-2b">103.2b</a>.) Once during the game, any time you have priority and the stack is empty, but only during a main phase of your turn, you may pay <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-3"><span class="sr-only">{3}</span></span></span> and put that card into your hand. This is a special action that doesn’t use the stack (see rule <a href="#section-116-2g">116.2g</a>). This is a change from previous rules.

  .rule_text Whenever a step or phase begins, if it’s a step or phase that has any turn-based action associated with it, those turn-based actions are automatically dealt with first. This happens before state-based actions are checked, before triggered abilities are put on the stack, and before players receive priority.
.rule{id: "section-703-4"}

  .rule_text The turn-based actions are as follows:
.rule{id: "section-703-4a"}
  .rule_id 703.4a
  .rule_text Immediately after the untap step begins, all phased-in permanents with phasing that the active player controls phase out, and all phased-out permanents that the active player controlled when they phased out phase in. This all happens simultaneously. See rule <a href="#section-502-1">502.1</a>.
.rule{id: "section-703-4b"}
  .rule_id 703.4b
  .rule_text Immediately after the phasing action has been completed during the untap step, if the game has either the day or night designation, it checks to see whether that designation should change. If it’s neither day nor night, this check doesn’t happen. See rule <a href="#section-502-2">502.2</a>.
.rule{id: "section-703-4c"}
  .rule_id 703.4c
  .rule_text Immediately after the game checks to see if its day or night designation should change during the untap step or, if the game doesn’t have a day or night designation, immediately after the phasing action has been completed during the untap step, the active player determines which permanents they control will untap. Then they untap them all simultaneously. See rule <a href="#section-502-3">502.3</a>.

  .rule_text State-Based Actions
.rule{id: "section-704-1"}
  .rule_id 704.1.
  .rule_text State-based actions are game actions that happen automatically whenever certain conditions (listed below) are met. State-based actions don’t use the stack.
.rule{id: "section-704-1a"}
  .rule_id 704.1a
  .rule_text Abilities that watch for a specified game state are triggered abilities, not state-based actions. (See rule <a href="#section-603">603</a>, “Handling Triggered Abilities.”)
.rule{id: "section-704-2"}
  .rule_id 704.2.
  .rule_text State-based actions are checked throughout the game and are not controlled by any player.
.rule{id: "section-704-3"}
  .rule_id 704.3.
  .rule_text Whenever a player would get priority (see rule <a href="#section-117">117</a>, “Timing and Priority”), the game checks for any of the listed conditions for state-based actions, then performs all applicable state-based actions simultaneously as a single event. If any state-based actions are performed as a result of a check, the check is repeated; otherwise all triggered abilities that are waiting to be put on the stack are put on the stack, then the check is repeated. Once no more state-based actions have been performed as the result of a check and no triggered abilities are waiting to be put on the stack, the appropriate player gets priority. This process also occurs during the cleanup step (see rule <a href="#section-514">514</a>), except that if no state-based actions are performed as the result of the step’s first check and no triggered abilities are waiting to be put on the stack, then no player gets priority and the step ends.
.rule{id: "section-704-4"}
  .rule_id 704.4.
  .rule_text Unlike triggered abilities, state-based actions pay no attention to what happens during the resolution of a spell or ability.
  .rule_text Example: A player controls a creature with the ability “This creature’s power and toughness are each equal to the number of cards in your hand” and casts a spell whose effect is “Discard your hand, then draw seven cards.” The creature will temporarily have toughness 0 in the middle of the spell’s resolution but will be back up to toughness 7 when the spell finishes resolving. Thus the creature will survive when state-based actions are checked. In contrast, an ability that triggers when the player has no cards in hand goes on the stack after the spell resolves, because its trigger event happened during resolution.
.rule{id: "section-704-5"}
  .rule_id 704.5.
  .rule_text The state-based actions are as follows:
.rule{id: "section-704-5a"}

  .rule_text If a player has 0 or less life, that player loses the game.
.rule{id: "section-704-5b"}

  .rule_id 704.5g
  .rule_text If a creature has toughness greater than 0, it has damage marked on it, and the total damage marked on it is greater than or equal to its toughness, that creature has been dealt lethal damage and is destroyed. Regeneration can replace this event.
.rule{id: "section-704-5h"}
  .rule_id 704.5h
  .rule_text If a creature has toughness greater than 0, and it’s been dealt damage by a source with deathtouch since the last time state-based actions were checked, that creature is destroyed. Regeneration can replace this event.

.rule{id: "section-704-5k"}
  .rule_id 704.5k
  .rule_text If two or more permanents have the supertype world, all except the one that has had the world supertype for the shortest amount of time are put into their owners’ graveyards. In the event of a tie for the shortest amount of time, all are put into their owners’ graveyards. This is called the “world rule.”
.rule{id: "section-704-5m"}
  .rule_id 704.5m

.rule{id: "section-704-5q"}
  .rule_id 704.5q
  .rule_text If a permanent has both a +1/+1 counter and a -1/-1 counter on it, N +1/+1 and N -1/-1 counters are removed from it, where N is the smaller of the number of +1/+1 and -1/-1 counters on it.
.rule{id: "section-704-5r"}
  .rule_id 704.5r

.rule{id: "section-704-5w"}
  .rule_id 704.5w
  .rule_text If a battle has no player in the game designated as its protector and no attacking creatures are currently attacking that battle, that battle’s controller chooses an appropriate player to be its protector based on its battle type. If no player can be chosen this way, the battle is put into its owner’s graveyard. See rule <a href="#section-310">310</a>, “Battles.”
.rule{id: "section-704-5x"}

.rule{id: "section-704-6e"}
  .rule_id 704.6e
  .rule_text In an Archenemy game, if a non-ongoing scheme card is face up in the command zone, and no triggered abilities of any scheme are on the stack or waiting to be put on the stack, that scheme card is turned face down and put on the bottom of its owner’s scheme deck. See rule <a href="#section-904">904</a>, “Archenemy.”
.rule{id: "section-704-6f"}
  .rule_id 704.6f
  .rule_text In a Planechase game, if a phenomenon card is face up in the command zone, and it isn’t the source of a triggered ability that has triggered but not yet left the stack, the planar controller planeswalks. See rule <a href="#section-901">901</a>, “Planechase.”
.rule{id: "section-704-7"}
  .rule_id 704.7.
  .rule_text If multiple state-based actions would have the same result at the same time, a single replacement effect will replace all of them.
  .rule_text Example: You control Lich’s Mirror, which says “If you would lose the game, instead shuffle your hand, your graveyard, and all permanents you own into your library, then draw seven cards and your life total becomes 20.” There’s one card in your library and your life total is 1. A spell causes you to draw two cards and lose 2 life. The next time state-based actions are checked, you’d lose the game due to rule <a href="#section-704-5a">704.5a</a> and rule <a href="#section-704-5b">704.5b</a>. Instead, Lich’s Mirror replaces that game loss and you keep playing.
.rule{id: "section-704-8"}
  .rule_id 704.8.
  .rule_text If a state-based action results in a permanent leaving the battlefield at the same time other state-based actions were performed, that permanent’s last known information is derived from the game state before any of those state-based actions were performed.
  .rule_text Example: You control Young Wolf, a 1/1 creature with undying, and it has a +1/+1 counter on it. A spell puts three -1/-1 counters on Young Wolf. Before state-based actions are performed, Young Wolf has one +1/+1 counter and three -1/-1 counters on it. After state-based actions are performed, Young Wolf is in the graveyard. When it was last on the battlefield, it had a +1/+1 counter on it, so undying will not trigger.

  .rule_id 705.
  .rule_text Flipping a Coin
.rule{id: "section-705-1"}
  .rule_id 705.1.
  .rule_text Some cards refer to flipping a coin. A coin used in a flip must be a two-sided object with easily distinguished sides and equal likelihood that either side lands face up. If the coin that’s being flipped doesn’t have an obvious “heads” or “tails,” designate one side to be “heads,” and the other side to be “tails.” Other methods of randomization may be substituted for flipping a coin as long as there are two possible outcomes of equal likelihood and all players agree to the substitution. For example, the player may roll an even-sided die and call “odds” or “evens,” or roll an even-sided die and designate that “odds” means “heads” and “evens” means “tails.”
.rule{id: "section-705-2"}
  .rule_id 705.2.
  .rule_text Some effects that instruct a player to flip a coin care only about whether the coin comes up heads or tails. No player wins or loses a coin flip for this kind of effect. For all other effects that instruct a player to flip a coin, the player that flips the coin calls “heads” or “tails.” If the call matches the result, the player wins the flip. Otherwise, the player loses the flip. Only the player who flips the coin wins or loses the flip; no other players are involved.

  .rule_text Rolling a Die
.rule{id: "section-706-1"}
  .rule_id 706.1.
  .rule_text An effect that instructs a player to roll a die will specify what kind of die to roll and how many of those dice to roll.
.rule{id: "section-706-1a"}
  .rule_id 706.1a
  .rule_text Such an effect may refer to an “N-sided die,” “N-sided dice,” or one or more “dN,” where N is a positive integer. In those cases, the die must have N equally likely outcomes, numbered from 1 to N. For example, a d20 is a twenty-sided die with possible outcomes from 1 to 20.
.rule{id: "section-706-1b"}
  .rule_id 706.1b
  .rule_text Players may agree to use an alternate method for rolling a die, including a digital substitute, as long as the method used has the same number of equally likely outcomes as the die specified in the instruction.
.rule{id: "section-706-2"}
  .rule_id 706.2.
  .rule_text After the roll, the number indicated on the top face of the die before any modifiers is the natural result. The instruction may include modifiers to the roll which add to or subtract from the natural result. Modifiers may also come from other sources. After considering all applicable modifiers, the final number is the result of the die roll.
.rule{id: "section-706-2a"}
  .rule_id 706.2a
  .rule_text Modifiers may be optional and/or have associated costs. If a modifier has an associated mana cost, the player who rolled has the chance to activate mana abilities before applying it.
.rule{id: "section-706-2b"}
  .rule_id 706.2b
  .rule_text If two or more effects are attempting to modify the natural result, the player who rolled chooses one to apply, following these steps: First, consider any effects that modify the result of a die roll by rerolling that die. Second, consider any effects that modify the result of a die roll by increasing or decreasing that result by a specified amount.
.rule{id: "section-706-3"}
  .rule_id 706.3.
  .rule_text Some abilities that instruct a player to roll one or more dice include a results table.
.rule{id: "section-706-3a"}
  .rule_id 706.3a
  .rule_text The results table appears as a list or as a chart with multiple striations. Each list item or striation includes possible results and an effect associated with those results. The possible results indicated could be a single number, a range of numbers with two endpoints in the form “N1–N2,” or a range with a single endpoint in the form “N+.” Each one means “If the result was in this range, [effect].” After a die roll, use the result to determine which effect listed on the results table happens, if any.
.rule{id: "section-706-3b"}
  .rule_id 706.3b
  .rule_text An instruction to roll one or more dice, any instructions to modify that roll printed in the same paragraph, any additional instructions based on the result of the roll, and the associated results table are all part of one ability.
.rule{id: "section-706-3c"}
  .rule_id 706.3c
  .rule_text Some effects in results charts include the text “Roll again.” This additional roll uses the same kind of and number of dice originally called for, including any applicable modifiers.
.rule{id: "section-706-4"}
  .rule_id 706.4.
  .rule_text Some abilities that instruct a player to roll one or more dice do not include a results table. The text of those abilities will indicate how to use the results of the die rolls, if at all.
.rule{id: "section-706-5"}
  .rule_id 706.5.
  .rule_text One card (Celebr-8000) has an ability that instructs a player to roll two dice and has an additional effect if that player “rolled doubles.” A player has rolled doubles if the result of each of those rolls is equal to the other.
.rule{id: "section-706-6"}
  .rule_id 706.6.
  .rule_text If a player is instructed to ignore a roll, that roll is considered to have never happened. No abilities trigger because of the ignored roll, and no effects apply to that roll. If that player was instructed to ignore the lowest roll and multiple results are tied for the lowest, the player chooses one of those rolls to be ignored.
.rule{id: "section-706-7"}
  .rule_id 706.7.
  .rule_text In a Planechase game, rolling the planar die will cause any ability that triggers whenever a player rolls one or more dice to trigger. However, any effect that refers to a numerical result of a die roll, including ones that exchange the results of that roll with another value or compare the results of that roll to other rolls or to a given number, ignores the rolling of the planar die. See rule <a href="#section-901">901</a>, “Planechase.”
.rule{id: "section-706-8"}
  .rule_id 706.8.
  .rule_text One card (Centaur of Attention) has an ability that instructs a player to roll dice and “store” those results on it and another ability that allows a player to reroll any number of those results.
.rule{id: "section-706-8a"}
  .rule_id 706.8a
  .rule_text To store the result of a die roll on a permanent means to note both the kind of die rolled and the result of that roll. That noted information is considered a “stored result” of that permanent, and the result is the “value” of that stored result.

  .rule_text Copying Objects
.rule{id: "section-707-1"}
  .rule_id 707.1.
  .rule_text Some objects become or turn another object into a “copy” of a spell, permanent, or card. Some effects create a token that’s a copy of another object. (Certain older cards were printed with the phrase “search for a copy.” This section doesn’t cover those cards, which have received new text in the Oracle card reference.)
.rule{id: "section-707-2"}
  .rule_id 707.2.
  .rule_text When copying an object, the copy acquires the copiable values of the original object’s characteristics and, for an object on the stack, choices made when casting or activating it (mode, targets, the value of X, whether it was kicked, how it will affect multiple targets, and so on). The copiable values are the values derived from the text printed on the object (that text being name, mana cost, color indicator, card type, subtype, supertype, rules text, power, toughness, and/or loyalty), as modified by other copy effects, by its face-down status, and by “as . . . enters the battlefield” and “as . . . is turned face up” abilities that set power and toughness (and may also set additional characteristics). Other effects (including type-changing and text-changing effects), status, counters, and stickers are not copied.
  .rule_text Example: Chimeric Staff is an artifact that reads, “<span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-x"><span class="sr-only">{X}</span></span></span>: Chimeric Staff becomes an X/X artifact creature until end of turn.” Clone is a creature that reads, “You may have Clone enter the battlefield as a copy of any creature on the battlefield.” After a Staff has become a 5/5 artifact creature, a Clone enters the battlefield as a copy of it. The Clone is an artifact, not a 5/5 artifact creature. (The copy has the Staff’s ability, however, and will become a creature if that ability is activated.)
  .rule_text Example: Clone enters the battlefield as a copy of a face-down Grinning Demon (a creature with morph <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-2"><span class="sr-only">{2}</span></span><span class="mana mana-cost mana-b"><span class="sr-only">{B}</span></span><span class="mana mana-cost mana-b"><span class="sr-only">{B}</span></span></span>). The Clone is a colorless 2/2 creature with no name, no types, no abilities, and no mana cost. It will still be face up. Its controller can’t pay <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-2"><span class="sr-only">{2}</span></span><span class="mana mana-cost mana-b"><span class="sr-only">{B}</span></span><span class="mana mana-cost mana-b"><span class="sr-only">{B}</span></span></span> to turn it face up.
.rule{id: "section-707-2a"}
  .rule_id 707.2a
  .rule_text A copy acquires the color of the object it’s copying because that value is derived from its mana cost or color indicator. A copy acquires the abilities of the object it’s copying because those values are derived from its rules text. A copy doesn’t wind up with two values of each ability (that is, it doesn’t copy the object’s abilities and its rules text, then have that rules text define a new set of abilities).
.rule{id: "section-707-2b"}
  .rule_id 707.2b
  .rule_text Once an object has been copied, changing the copiable values of the original object won’t cause the copy to change.

  .rule_id 707.2c
  .rule_text If a static ability generates a continuous effect that’s a copy effect, the copiable values that effect grants are determined only at the time that effect first starts to apply.
.rule{id: "section-707-3"}
  .rule_id 707.3.
  .rule_text The copy’s copiable values become the copied information, as modified by the copy’s status (see rule <a href="#section-110-5">110.5</a>). Objects that copy the object will use the new copiable values.
  .rule_text Example: Vesuvan Doppelganger reads, “You may have Vesuvan Doppelganger enter the battlefield as a copy of any creature on the battlefield, except it doesn’t copy that creature’s color and it has ‘At the beginning of your upkeep, you may have this creature become a copy of target creature, except it doesn’t copy that creature’s color and it has this ability.’” A Vesuvan Doppelganger enters the battlefield as a copy of Runeclaw Bear (a 2/2 green Bear creature with no abilities). Then a Clone enters the battlefield as a copy of the Doppelganger. The Clone is a 2/2 blue Bear named Runeclaw Bear that has the Doppelganger’s upkeep-triggered ability.
  .rule_text Example: Tomoya the Revealer (a flipped flip card) becomes a copy of Nezumi Shortfang (an unflipped flip card). Tomoya’s characteristics become the characteristics of Stabwhisker the Odious, which is the flipped version of Nezumi Shortfang.
  .rule_text Example: A face-down Grinning Demon (a creature with morph) becomes a copy of a face-up Branchsnap Lorian (a 4/1 green creature with trample and morph <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-g"><span class="sr-only">{G}</span></span></span>). The Demon’s characteristics become the characteristics of Branchsnap Lorian. However, since the creature is face down, it remains a 2/2 colorless creature with no name, types, or abilities, and no mana cost. It can be turned face up for <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-g"><span class="sr-only">{G}</span></span></span>. If it’s turned face up, it will have the characteristics of Branchsnap Lorian.
  .rule_text Example: A face-down Grinning Demon (a creature with morph) becomes a copy of Wandering Ones (a 1/1 blue Spirit creature that doesn’t have morph). It will be a face-down Wandering Ones. It remains a 2/2 colorless creature with no name, types, or abilities, and no mana cost. Its controller can’t turn it face up as a special action. If an effect turns it face up, it will have the characteristics of Wandering Ones.
.rule{id: "section-707-4"}
  .rule_id 707.4.
  .rule_text Some effects cause a permanent that’s copying a permanent to copy a different object while remaining on the battlefield. The change doesn’t trigger enters-the-battlefield or leaves-the-battlefield abilities. This also doesn’t change any noncopy effects presently affecting the permanent.
  .rule_text Example: Unstable Shapeshifter reads, “Whenever a creature enters the battlefield, Unstable Shapeshifter becomes a copy of that creature and gains this ability.” It’s affected by Giant Growth, which reads “Target creature gets +3/+3 until end of turn.” If a creature enters the battlefield later this turn, Unstable Shapeshifter will become a copy of that creature, but it will still get +3/+3 from the Giant Growth.
.rule{id: "section-707-5"}
  .rule_id 707.5.
  .rule_text An object that enters the battlefield “as a copy” or “that’s a copy” of another object becomes a copy as it enters the battlefield. It doesn’t enter the battlefield, and then become a copy of that permanent. If the text that’s being copied includes any abilities that replace the enters-the-battlefield event (such as “enters the battlefield with” or “as [this] enters the battlefield” abilities), those abilities will take effect. Also, any enters-the-battlefield triggered abilities of the copy will have a chance to trigger.
  .rule_text Example: Skyshroud Behemoth reads, “Fading 2 (This creature enters the battlefield with two fade counters on it. At the beginning of your upkeep, remove a fade counter from it. If you can’t, sacrifice it.)” and “Skyshroud Behemoth enters the battlefield tapped.” A Clone that enters the battlefield as a copy of a Skyshroud Behemoth will also enter the battlefield tapped with two fade counters on it.
  .rule_text Example: Wall of Omens reads, “When Wall of Omens enters the battlefield, draw a card.” A Clone enters the battlefield as a copy of Wall of Omens. The Clone has the Wall’s enters-the-battlefield triggered ability, so the Clone’s controller draws a card.
.rule{id: "section-707-6"}
  .rule_id 707.6.
  .rule_text When copying a permanent, any choices that have been made for that permanent aren’t copied. Instead, if an object enters the battlefield as a copy of another permanent, the object’s controller will get to make any “as [this] enters the battlefield” choices for it.
  .rule_text Example: A Clone enters the battlefield as a copy of Adaptive Automaton. Adaptive Automaton reads, in part, “As Adaptive Automaton enters the battlefield, choose a creature type.” The Clone won’t copy the creature type choice of the Automaton; rather, the controller of the Clone will get to make a new choice.
.rule{id: "section-707-7"}
  .rule_id 707.7.
  .rule_text If a pair of linked abilities are copied, those abilities will be similarly linked to one another on the object that copied them. One ability refers only to actions that were taken or objects that were affected by the other. They can’t be linked to any other ability, regardless of what other abilities the copy may currently have or may have had in the past. See rule <a href="#section-607">607</a>, “Linked Abilities.”
.rule{id: "section-707-8"}
  .rule_id 707.8.
  .rule_text When copying a melded permanent or other double-faced permanent, use the copiable values of the face that’s currently up to determine the characteristics of the copy. See rule <a href="#section-712">712</a>, “Double-Faced Cards.”
.rule{id: "section-707-8a"}
  .rule_id 707.8a
  .rule_text If an effect creates a token that is a copy of a transforming permanent or a transforming double-faced card not on the battlefield, the resulting token is a transforming token that has both a front face and a back face. The characteristics of each face are determined by the copiable values of the same face of the permanent it is a copy of, as modified by any other copy effects that apply to that permanent. If the token is a copy of a transforming permanent with its back face up, the token enters the battlefield with its back face up. This rule does not apply to tokens that are created with their own set of characteristics and enter the battlefield as a copy of a transforming permanent due to a replacement effect.
  .rule_text Example: Afflicted Deserter is the front face of a transforming double-faced card, and the name of its back face is Werewolf Ransacker. If an effect creates a token that is a copy of that transforming permanent, the token also has the same two faces and can transform. It enters the battlefield with the same face up as the permanent that it is a copy of.
  .rule_text Example: Clone is not a transforming double-faced card, so a token that is created as a copy of a Clone is not a transforming token, even if it enters the battlefield as a copy of a transforming permanent due to Clone’s replacement effect.
.rule{id: "section-707-9"}
  .rule_id 707.9.
  .rule_text Copy effects may include modifications or exceptions to the copying process.
.rule{id: "section-707-9a"}
  .rule_id 707.9a
  .rule_text Some copy effects cause the copy to gain an ability as part of the copying process. This ability becomes part of the copiable values for the copy, along with any other abilities that were copied.
  .rule_text Example: Quirion Elves enters the battlefield and an Unstable Shapeshifter copies it. The copiable values of the Shapeshifter now match those of the Elves, except that the Shapeshifter also has the ability “Whenever a creature enters the battlefield, Unstable Shapeshifter becomes a copy of that creature, except it has this ability.” Then a Clone enters the battlefield as a copy of the Unstable Shapeshifter. The Clone copies the new copiable values of the Shapeshifter, including the ability that the Shapeshifter gave itself when it copied the Elves.
.rule{id: "section-707-9b"}
  .rule_id 707.9b
  .rule_text Some copy effects modify a characteristic as part of the copying process. The final set of values for that characteristic becomes part of the copiable values of the copy.
  .rule_text Example: Copy Artifact is an enchantment that reads, “You may have Copy Artifact enter the battlefield as a copy of any artifact on the battlefield, except it’s an enchantment in addition to its other types.” It enters the battlefield as a copy of Juggernaut. The copiable values of the Copy Artifact now match those of Juggernaut with one modification: its types are now artifact, creature, and enchantment.
.rule{id: "section-707-9c"}
  .rule_id 707.9c
  .rule_text Some copy effects specifically state that they don’t copy certain characteristics and the affected objects instead retain their original values. Copy effects may also simply state that certain characteristics are not copied.
.rule{id: "section-707-9d"}
  .rule_id 707.9d
  .rule_text When applying a copy effect that doesn’t copy a certain characteristic, retains one or more original values for a certain characteristic, or provides a specific set of values for a certain characteristic, any characteristic-defining ability (see rule <a href="#section-604-3">604.3</a>) of the object being copied that defines that characteristic is not copied. If that characteristic is color, any color indicator (see rule <a href="#section-204">204</a>) of that object is also not copied. This rule does not apply to copy effects with exceptions that state the object is a certain card type, supertype, and/or subtype “in addition to its other types.” In those cases, any characteristic-defining ability that defines card type, supertype, and/or subtype is copied.
  .rule_text Example: Quicksilver Gargantuan is a creature that reads, “You may have Quicksilver Gargantuan enter the battlefield as a copy of any creature on the battlefield, except it’s 7/7.” Quicksilver Gargantuan enters the battlefield as a copy of Tarmogoyf, which has a characteristic-defining ability that defines its power and toughness. Quicksilver Gargantuan does not have that ability. It will be 7/7.
  .rule_text Example: Glasspool Mimic is a creature that reads “You may have Glasspool Mimic enter the battlefield as a copy of a creature you control, except it’s a Shapeshifter Rogue in addition to its other types.” Glasspool Mimic enters the battlefield as a copy of a creature with changeling. Glasspool Mimic will have changeling and will have all creature types.
.rule{id: "section-707-9e"}
  .rule_id 707.9e
  .rule_text Some replacement effects that generate copy effects include an exception that’s an additional effect rather than a modification of the affected object’s characteristics. If another copy effect is applied to that object after applying the copy effect with that exception, the exception’s effect doesn’t happen.
  .rule_text Example: Altered Ego reads, “You may have Altered Ego enter the battlefield as a copy of any creature on the battlefield, except it enters with X additional +1/+1 counters on it.” You choose for it to enter the battlefield as a copy of Clone, which reads “You may have Clone enter the battlefield as a copy of any creature on the battlefield,” for which no creature was chosen as it entered the battlefield. If you then choose a creature to copy as you apply the replacement effect Altered Ego gains by copying Clone, Altered Ego’s replacement effect won’t cause it to enter the battlefield with any +1/+1 counters on it.
.rule{id: "section-707-9f"}
  .rule_id 707.9f
  .rule_text Some exceptions to the copying process apply only if the copy is or has certain characteristics. To determine whether such an exception applies, consider what the resulting permanent’s characteristics would be if the copy effect were applied without that exception, taking into account any other exceptions that effect includes.
  .rule_text Example: Moritte of the Frost says, in part, “You may have Moritte of the Frost enter the battlefield as a copy of a permanent you control, except it’s legendary and snow in addition to its other types and, if it’s a creature, it enters with two additional +1/+1 counters on it and it has changeling.” Moritte of the Frost copies a land that has become a creature until end of turn. It would enter as a noncreature permanent, so it won’t enter with two additional +1+1 counters on it and it won’t have changeling, even if it becomes a creature later in the turn.
.rule{id: "section-707-9g"}
  .rule_id 707.9g
  .rule_text Some replacement effects that generate copy effects are linked to triggered abilities written in the same paragraph. (See rule <a href="#section-603-11">603.11</a>.) If another copy effect is applied to that object after applying the copy effect with the linked triggered ability, the ability doesn’t trigger.
.rule{id: "section-707-10"}
  .rule_id 707.10.
  .rule_text To copy a spell, activated ability, or triggered ability means to put a copy of it onto the stack; a copy of a spell isn’t cast and a copy of an activated ability isn’t activated. A copy of a spell or ability copies both the characteristics of the spell or ability and all decisions made for it, including modes, targets, the value of X, and additional or alternative costs. (See rule <a href="#section-601">601</a>, “Casting Spells.”) Choices that are normally made on resolution are not copied. If an effect of the copy refers to objects used to pay its costs, it uses the objects used to pay the costs of the original spell or ability. A copy of a spell is owned by the player under whose control it was put on the stack. A copy of a spell or ability is controlled by the player under whose control it was put on the stack. A copy of a spell is itself a spell, even though it has no spell card associated with it. A copy of an ability is itself an ability.
  .rule_text Example: A player casts Fork, targeting an Emerald Charm. Fork reads, “Copy target instant or sorcery spell, except that the copy is red. You may choose new targets for the copy.” Emerald Charm is a modal green instant. When the Fork resolves, it puts a copy of the Emerald Charm on the stack except the copy is red, not green. The copy has the same mode that was chosen for the original Emerald Charm. It does not necessarily have the same target, but only because Fork allows choosing of new targets.
  .rule_text Example: Fling is an instant that reads, “As an additional cost to cast this spell, sacrifice a creature” and “Fling deals damage equal to the sacrificed creature’s power to any target.” When determining how much damage a copy of Fling deals, it checks the power of the creature sacrificed to pay for the original Fling.
  .rule_text Example: Dawnglow Infusion is a sorcery that reads, “You gain X life if <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-g"><span class="sr-only">{G}</span></span></span> was spent to cast this spell and X life if <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-w"><span class="sr-only">{W}</span></span></span> was spent to cast it.” Because mana isn’t an object, a copy of Dawnglow Infusion won’t cause you to gain any life, no matter what mana was spent to cast the original spell.
.rule{id: "section-707-10a"}
  .rule_id 707.10a
  .rule_text If a copy of a spell is in a zone other than the stack, it ceases to exist. If a copy of a card is in any zone other than the stack or the battlefield, it ceases to exist. These are state-based actions. See rule <a href="#section-704">704</a>.
.rule{id: "section-707-10b"}
  .rule_id 707.10b
  .rule_text A copy of an ability has the same source as the original ability. If the ability refers to its source by name, the copy refers to that same object and not to any other object with the same name. The copy is considered to be the same ability by effects that count how many times that ability has resolved during the turn.
.rule{id: "section-707-10c"}
  .rule_id 707.10c
  .rule_text Some effects copy a spell or ability and state that its controller may choose new targets for the copy. The player may leave any number of the targets unchanged, even if those targets would be illegal. If the player chooses to change some or all of the targets, the new targets must be legal. Once the player has decided what the copy’s targets will be, the copy is put onto the stack with those targets.
.rule{id: "section-707-10d"}
  .rule_id 707.10d
  .rule_text Some effects copy a spell or ability for each player or object it “could target.” The copies are put onto the stack with those targets in the order of their controller’s choice. If the spell or ability has more than one target, each of its targets must be the same player or object. If that player or object isn’t a legal target for each instance of the word “target,” a copy isn’t created for that player or object.
.rule{id: "section-707-10e"}
  .rule_id 707.10e
  .rule_text Some effects copy a spell or ability and specify a new target for the copy. If the spell or ability has more than one target, each of the copy’s targets must be that player or object. If that player or object isn’t a legal target for each instance of the word “target,” the copy isn’t created.
.rule{id: "section-707-10f"}
  .rule_id 707.10f
  .rule_text Some effects copy a permanent spell. As that copy resolves, it ceases being a copy of a spell and becomes a token permanent. (See rule <a href="#section-608-3f">608.3f</a>.)
.rule{id: "section-707-10g"}
  .rule_id 707.10g
  .rule_text If an effect creates a copy of a transforming permanent spell, the copy is also a transforming permanent spell that has both a front face and a back face. The characteristics of its front and back face are determined by the copiable values of the same face of the spell it is a copy of, as modified by any other copy effects. If the spell it is a copy of has its back face up, the copy is created with its back face up. The token that’s put onto the battlefield as that spell resolves is a transforming token.
.rule{id: "section-707-11"}
  .rule_id 707.11.
  .rule_text If an effect refers to a permanent by name, the effect still tracks that permanent even if it changes names or becomes a copy of something else.
  .rule_text Example: An Unstable Shapeshifter copies a Crazed Armodon. Crazed Armodon reads, “<span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-g"><span class="sr-only">{G}</span></span></span>: Crazed Armodon gets +3/+0 and gains trample until end of turn. Destroy Crazed Armodon at the beginning of the next end step. Activate only once each turn.” If this ability of the Shapeshifter is activated, the Shapeshifter will be destroyed at the beginning of the next end step, even if it’s no longer a copy of Crazed Armodon at that time.
.rule{id: "section-707-12"}
  .rule_id 707.12.
  .rule_text An effect that instructs a player to cast a copy of an object (and not just copy a spell) follows the rules for casting spells, except that the copy is created in the same zone the object is in and then cast while another spell or ability is resolving. Casting a copy of an object follows steps <a href="#section-601-2a">601.2a</a>–h of rule <a href="#section-601">601</a>, “Casting Spells,” and then the copy becomes cast. Once cast, the copy is a spell on the stack, and just like any other spell it can resolve or be countered.

  .rule_text If a face-up permanent is turned face down by a spell or ability that doesn’t list any characteristics for that object, it becomes a 2/2 face-down creature with no text, no name, no subtypes, and no mana cost. A permanent that enters the battlefield face down also has these characteristics unless otherwise specified by the effect that put it onto the battlefield face down or allowed it to be cast face down. These values are the copiable values of that object’s characteristics.
.rule{id: "section-708-3"}

.rule{id: "section-708-4"}
  .rule_id 708.4.
  .rule_text Objects that are cast face down are turned face down before they are put onto the stack, so effects that care about the characteristics of a spell will see only the face-down spell’s characteristics. Any effects or prohibitions that would apply to casting an object with these characteristics (and not the face-up object’s characteristics) are applied to casting this object. The permanent the spell becomes will be a face-down permanent.

  .rule_text If you control multiple face-down spells or face-down permanents, you must ensure at all times that your face-down spells and permanents can be easily differentiated from each other. This includes, but is not limited to, knowing what ability or rules caused the permanents to be face down, the order spells were cast, the order that face-down permanents entered the battlefield, which creature(s) attacked last turn, and any other differences between face-down spells or permanents. Common methods for distinguishing between face-down objects include using counters or dice to mark the different objects, or clearly placing those objects in order on the table.

  .rule_id 709.1.
  .rule_text Split cards have two card faces on a single card. The back of a split card is the normal Magic card back.
.rule{id: "section-709-2"}
  .rule_id 709.2.
  .rule_text Although split cards have two castable halves, each split card is only one card. For example, a player who has drawn or discarded a split card has drawn or discarded one card, not two.
.rule{id: "section-709-3"}
  .rule_id 709.3.
  .rule_text A player chooses which half of a split card they are casting before putting it onto the stack.
.rule{id: "section-709-3a"}
  .rule_id 709.3a
  .rule_text Only the chosen half is evaluated to see if it can be cast. Only that half is considered to be put onto the stack.
.rule{id: "section-709-3b"}
  .rule_id 709.3b
  .rule_text While on the stack, only the characteristics of the half being cast exist. The other half’s characteristics are treated as though they didn’t exist.
.rule{id: "section-709-3c"}
  .rule_id 709.3c
  .rule_text An effect may create a copy of a split card and allow a player to cast the copy. That copy retains the characteristics of the two halves separated into the same two halves as the original card. (See rule <a href="#section-707-12">707.12</a>.)
.rule{id: "section-709-4"}
  .rule_id 709.4.
  .rule_text In every zone except the stack, the characteristics of a split card are those of its two halves combined. This is a change from previous rules.
.rule{id: "section-709-4a"}
  .rule_id 709.4a
  .rule_text Each split card has two names. If an effect instructs a player to choose a card name and the player wants to choose a split card’s name, the player must choose one of those names and not both. An object has the chosen name if one of its names is the chosen name.
.rule{id: "section-709-4b"}
  .rule_id 709.4b
  .rule_text The mana cost of a split card is the combined mana costs of its two halves. A split card’s colors and mana value are determined from its combined mana cost. An effect that refers specifically to the symbols in a split card’s mana cost sees the separate symbols rather than the whole mana cost.
  .rule_text Example: Assault//Battery’s mana cost is <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-3"><span class="sr-only">{3}</span></span><span class="mana mana-cost mana-r"><span class="sr-only">{R}</span></span><span class="mana mana-cost mana-g"><span class="sr-only">{G}</span></span></span>. It’s a red and green card with a mana value of 5. If you cast Assault, the resulting spell is a red spell with a mana value of 1.
  .rule_text Example: Fire//Ice’s mana cost is <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-2"><span class="sr-only">{2}</span></span><span class="mana mana-cost mana-u"><span class="sr-only">{U}</span></span><span class="mana mana-cost mana-r"><span class="sr-only">{R}</span></span></span>. It has the same mana cost as Steam Augury, but an effect such as that of Jegantha, the Wellspring sees that it contains the mana symbol <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-1"><span class="sr-only">{1}</span></span></span> twice.
.rule{id: "section-709-4c"}
  .rule_id 709.4c
  .rule_text A split card has each card type specified on either of its halves and each ability in the text box of each half.
.rule{id: "section-709-4d"}
  .rule_id 709.4d
  .rule_text The characteristics of a fused split spell on the stack are also those of its two halves combined (see rule <a href="#section-702-102">702.102</a>, “Fuse”).
.rule{id: "section-710"}
  .rule_id 710.
  .rule_text Flip Cards
.rule{id: "section-710-1"}
  .rule_id 710.1.
  .rule_text Flip cards have a two-part card frame on a single card. The text that appears right side up on the card defines the card’s normal characteristics. Additional alternative characteristics appear upside down on the card. The back of a flip card is the normal Magic card back.
.rule{id: "section-710-1a"}
  .rule_id 710.1a
  .rule_text The top half of a flip card contains the card’s normal name, text box, type line, power, and toughness. The text box usually contains an ability that causes the permanent to “flip” if certain conditions are met.
.rule{id: "section-710-1b"}
  .rule_id 710.1b
  .rule_text The bottom half of a flip card contains an alternative name, text box, type line, power, and toughness. These characteristics are used only if the permanent is on the battlefield and only if the permanent is flipped.
.rule{id: "section-710-1c"}
  .rule_id 710.1c
  .rule_text A flip card’s color and mana cost don’t change if the permanent is flipped. Also, any changes to it by external effects will still apply.
.rule{id: "section-710-2"}
  .rule_id 710.2.
  .rule_text In every zone other than the battlefield, and also on the battlefield before the permanent flips, a flip card has only the normal characteristics of the card. Once a permanent is flipped, its normal name, text box, type line, power, and toughness don’t apply and the alternative versions of those characteristics apply instead.
  .rule_text Example: Akki Lavarunner is a nonlegendary creature that flips into a legendary creature named Tok-Tok, Volcano Born. An effect that says “Search your library for a legendary card” can’t find this flip card. An effect that says “Legendary creatures get +2/+2” doesn’t affect Akki Lavarunner, but it does affect Tok-Tok.
.rule{id: "section-710-3"}
  .rule_id 710.3.
  .rule_text You must ensure that it’s clear at all times whether a permanent you control is flipped or not, both when it’s untapped and when it’s tapped. Common methods for distinguishing between flipped and unflipped permanents include using coins or dice to mark flipped objects.
.rule{id: "section-710-4"}
  .rule_id 710.4.
  .rule_text Flipping a permanent is a one-way process. Once a permanent is flipped, it’s impossible for it to become unflipped. However, if a flipped permanent leaves the battlefield, it retains no memory of its status. See rule <a href="#section-110-5">110.5</a>.
.rule{id: "section-710-5"}
  .rule_id 710.5.
  .rule_text If an effect instructs a player to choose a card name and the player wants to choose a flip card’s alternative name, the player may do so.
.rule{id: "section-711"}
  .rule_id 711.
  .rule_text Leveler Cards
.rule{id: "section-711-1"}
  .rule_id 711.1.
  .rule_text Each leveler card has a striated text box and three power/toughness boxes. The text box of a leveler card contains two level symbols.
.rule{id: "section-711-2"}
  .rule_id 711.2.
  .rule_text A level symbol is a keyword ability that represents a static ability. The level symbol includes either a range of numbers, indicated here as “N1-N2,” or a single number followed by a plus sign, indicated here as “N3+.” Any abilities printed within the same text box striation as a level symbol are part of its static ability. The same is true of the power/toughness box printed within that striation, indicated here as “[P/T].”
.rule{id: "section-711-2a"}
  .rule_id 711.2a
  .rule_text “<span class="manacost">{LEVEL N1-N2}</span> [Abilities] [P/T]” means “As long as this creature has at least N1 level counters on it, but no more than N2 level counters on it, it has base power and toughness [P/T] and has [abilities].”
.rule{id: "section-711-2b"}
  .rule_id 711.2b
  .rule_text “<span class="manacost">{LEVEL N3+}</span> [Abilities] [P/T]” means “As long as this creature has N3 or more level counters on it, it has base power and toughness [P/T] and has [abilities].”
.rule{id: "section-711-3"}
  .rule_id 711.3.
  .rule_text The text box striations have no game significance other than clearly demarcating which abilities and which power/toughness box are associated with which level symbol. Leveler cards each contain only one text box.
.rule{id: "section-711-4"}
  .rule_id 711.4.
  .rule_text Any ability a leveler card has that isn’t preceded by a level symbol is treated normally. In particular, each leveler permanent has its level up ability (see rule <a href="#section-702-87">702.87</a>) at all times; it may be activated regardless of how many level counters are on that permanent.
.rule{id: "section-711-5"}
  .rule_id 711.5.
  .rule_text If the number of level counters on a leveler creature is less than N1 (the first number printed in its <span class="manacost">{LEVEL N1-N2}</span> symbol), it has the power and toughness denoted by its uppermost power/toughness box.
.rule{id: "section-711-6"}
  .rule_id 711.6.
  .rule_text In every zone other than the battlefield, a leveler card has the power and toughness denoted by its uppermost power/toughness box.
.rule{id: "section-711-7"}
  .rule_id 711.7.
  .rule_text Some enchantments have the subtype Class and associated abilities that give them a class level. These are not level up abilities and class levels do not interact with level counters. See rule <a href="#section-716">716</a>, “Class Cards.”
.rule{id: "section-712"}
  .rule_id 712.
  .rule_text Double-Faced Cards
.rule{id: "section-712-1"}
  .rule_id 712.1.
  .rule_text A double-faced card has a Magic card face on one side and either a Magic card face or half of an oversized card face on the other. (It does not have a Magic card back.) There are three kinds of double-faced cards: transforming double-faced cards, modal double-faced cards, and meld cards.
.rule{id: "section-712-2"}
  .rule_id 712.2.
  .rule_text Transforming double-faced cards have a Magic card face on each side and include abilities on one or both of their faces that allow the card to either “transform” or “convert” (turn over to its other face) and/or allow the card to be cast or enter the battlefield “transformed” or “converted” (with its back face up).
.rule{id: "section-712-2a"}
  .rule_id 712.2a
  .rule_text A transforming double-faced card’s front face is marked by a front-face symbol in its upper left corner. On cards printed starting with The Brothers’ War™ release, that symbol is a single white triangle pointed upward inside a black circle. Transforming double-faced cards printed in older sets have different front-face symbols. On Magic Origins® and Core Set 2019 double-faced cards, the front-face symbol is a modified Planeswalker icon. On cards in the Innistrad® block, Shadows over Innistrad set, and Innistrad: Midnight Hunt set, as well as on Ulrich of the Krallenhorde in the Eldritch Moon™ set, the front-face symbol is a sun. On other Eldritch Moon double-faced cards, the front-face symbol is a full moon. On Ixalan™ and Rivals of Ixalan™ cards, the front-face symbol is a compass rose. On Kamigawa®: Neon Dynasty double-faced cards, the front-face symbol is a closed fan.
.rule{id: "section-712-2b"}
  .rule_id 712.2b
  .rule_text A transforming double-faced card’s back face is marked by a back-face symbol in its upper left corner. On cards printed starting with The Brothers’ War release, that symbol is a single white triangle pointed downward inside a black circle. Transforming double-faced cards printed in older sets have different front-face symbols. On Magic Origins and Core Set 2019 double-faced cards, the back-face symbol is a full Planeswalker icon. On cards in the Innistrad block, Shadows over Innistrad set, and Innistrad: Midnight Hunt set, as well as on Ulrich, Uncontested Alpha in the Eldritch Moon set, the back-face symbol is a crescent moon. On other Eldritch Moon double-faced cards, the back-face symbol is a stylized image of Emrakul. On Ixalan and Rivals of Ixalan cards, the back-face symbol is a land icon. On Kamigawa: Neon Dynasty double-faced cards, the back-face symbol is an open fan.
.rule{id: "section-712-2c"}
  .rule_id 712.2c
  .rule_text The front face of a transforming double-faced card whose back face is a creature has the back face’s power and toughness printed in gray above the power and toughness box. This is reminder text and has no effect on game play.
.rule{id: "section-712-3"}
  .rule_id 712.3.
  .rule_text Modal double-faced cards have a Magic card face on each side. These faces are independent from one another.
.rule{id: "section-712-3d"}
  .rule_id 712.3d
  .rule_text A modal double-faced card’s front face is marked by a front-face symbol in its upper left corner. The front-face symbol is a single black triangle inside a sideways teardrop.
.rule{id: "section-712-3e"}
  .rule_id 712.3e
  .rule_text A modal double-faced card’s back face is marked by a back-face symbol in its upper left corner. The back-face symbol is two white triangles inside a sideways teardrop.
.rule{id: "section-712-3f"}
  .rule_id 712.3f
  .rule_text Each face of a modal double-faced card includes a hint bar in the lower left corner with information about the opposite face. This is reminder text and has no effect on game play.
.rule{id: "section-712-4"}
  .rule_id 712.4.
  .rule_text Meld cards have a Magic card face on one side and half of an oversized card face on the other.
.rule{id: "section-712-4a"}
  .rule_id 712.4a
  .rule_text One card in each meld pair has an ability that exiles both that object and its counterpart and melds them. To meld the two cards in a meld pair, put them onto the battlefield with their back faces up and combined (see rule <a href="#section-701-37">701.37</a>, “Meld”). The resulting permanent is a single object represented by two cards.
.rule{id: "section-712-4b"}
  .rule_id 712.4b
  .rule_text The back faces of a meld pair are used only to determine the characteristics of the melded permanent that pair becomes on the battlefield. If a rule or effect references the back face of a meld card when not part of a melded permanent on the battlefield, it fails to determine its characteristics, regardless of which parts of the melded permanent is represented on that card’s back face.
.rule{id: "section-712-5"}
  .rule_id 712.5.
  .rule_text There are six specific meld pairs.

  .rule_text Players who are allowed to look at a double-faced card may look at both sides of that card.
.rule{id: "section-712-7"}
  .rule_id 712.7.
  .rule_text Players must ensure that double-faced cards in hidden zones are indistinguishable from other cards in the same zone. To do this, the owner of a double-faced card may use completely opaque card sleeves and/or a substitute card (see rule <a href="#section-713">713</a>). Sanctioned tournaments have additional rules for playing with double-faced cards. See rule <a href="#section-100-6">100.6</a>.
.rule{id: "section-712-8"}
  .rule_id 712.8.
  .rule_text Each face of a transforming or modal double-faced card has its own set of characteristics. The front face of each meld card and the combined face formed by a meld pair each has its own set of characteristics.
.rule{id: "section-712-8a"}
  .rule_id 712.8a
  .rule_text While a double-faced card is outside the game or in a zone other than the battlefield or stack, it has only the characteristics of its front face.
.rule{id: "section-712-8b"}
  .rule_id 712.8b
  .rule_text A meld card on the stack has only the characteristics of its front face.
.rule{id: "section-712-8c"}
  .rule_id 712.8c
  .rule_text Normally, a transforming double-faced spell has its front face up while on the stack and has only the characteristics of its front face. However, if an effect allows a player to cast a transforming double-faced card “transformed” or “converted,” the resulting spell will have its back face up and have only the characteristics of its back face. Its mana value is calculated using the mana cost of its front face.
.rule{id: "section-712-8d"}
  .rule_id 712.8d
  .rule_text While a double-faced permanent has its front face up, it has only the characteristics of its front face.
.rule{id: "section-712-8e"}
  .rule_id 712.8e
  .rule_text While a transforming double-faced permanent has its back face up, it has only the characteristics of its back face. However, its mana value is calculated using the mana cost of its front face. If a permanent is copying the back face of a transforming double-faced permanent (even if the object representing that copy is itself a double-faced permanent), the mana value of that permanent is 0. See rule <a href="#section-202-3b">202.3b</a>.
.rule{id: "section-712-8f"}
  .rule_id 712.8f
  .rule_text While a modal double-faced spell is on the stack or a modal double-faced permanent is on the battlefield, it has only the characteristics of the face that’s up.
.rule{id: "section-712-8g"}
  .rule_id 712.8g
  .rule_text While the two cards of a meld pair are on the battlefield as a melded permanent, the object represented by those cards has only the characteristics of the combined back face, and its mana value is the sum of the mana values of its front faces. If a permanent is copying a melded permanent, the mana value of the copy is 0. See rule <a href="#section-202-3c">202.3c</a>.
.rule{id: "section-712-9"}
  .rule_id 712.9.
  .rule_text Only transforming tokens and permanents represented by transforming double-faced cards can transform or convert. (See rule <a href="#section-701-28">701.28</a>, “Transform,” and rule <a href="#section-701-50">701.50</a>, “Convert.”) If a spell or ability instructs a player to transform or convert any permanent that isn’t a transforming token or isn’t represented by a transforming double-faced card, nothing happens.
  .rule_text Example: A Clone enters the battlefield as a copy of Wildblood Pack (the back face of a transforming double-faced card). The Clone will be a copy of the Wildblood Pack. Because the Clone is itself not a transforming double-faced card, it can’t transform.
  .rule_text Example: A player casts Cytoshape, causing a Kruin Outlaw (the front face of a transforming double-faced card) to become a copy of Elite Vanguard (a 2/1 Human Soldier creature) until end of turn. The player then casts Moonmist, which reads, in part, “Transform all Humans.” Because the copy of Elite Vanguard is a transforming double-faced card, it will transform. The resulting permanent will have its back face up, but it will still be a copy of Elite Vanguard that turn.
  .rule_text Example: A player controls Blackbloom Rogue, a Human Rogue that’s the front face of a modal double-faced card. They cast Moonmist. Blackbloom Rogue doesn’t transform.
.rule{id: "section-712-10"}
  .rule_id 712.10.
  .rule_text If a spell or ability instructs a player to transform or convert a permanent, and the face that permanent would transform or convert into is represented by an instant or sorcery card face, or is a transforming token that was created with an instant or sorcery face, nothing happens.
.rule{id: "section-712-11"}
  .rule_id 712.11.
  .rule_text A double-faced spell is cast with its front face up by default. See rule <a href="#section-601">601</a>, “Casting Spells.”
.rule{id: "section-712-11a"}
  .rule_id 712.11a
  .rule_text If a transforming double-faced card or a copy of a transforming double-faced card is cast as a spell “transformed” or “converted,” it’s put on the stack with its back face up.
.rule{id: "section-712-11b"}
  .rule_id 712.11b
  .rule_text A player casting a modal double-faced card as a spell chooses which face they are casting before putting it onto the stack.
.rule{id: "section-712-11c"}
  .rule_id 712.11c
  .rule_text Only the face that will be face up on the stack is evaluated to determine if it can be cast. Only that face is considered to be put onto the stack.
.rule{id: "section-712-11d"}
  .rule_id 712.11d
  .rule_text If an ability of a transforming double-faced card’s front face allows it to be cast “transformed” or “converted,” that ability is also considered when evaluating that spell to determine if it can be cast. This is an exception to <a href="#section-712-11c">712.11c</a>.
.rule{id: "section-712-12"}
  .rule_id 712.12.
  .rule_text A player playing a modal double-faced card as a land chooses one of its faces that’s a land before putting it onto the battlefield. It enters the battlefield with that face up. See rule <a href="#section-305">305</a>, “Lands.”
.rule{id: "section-712-13"}
  .rule_id 712.13.
  .rule_text By default, a resolving double-faced spell that becomes a permanent is put onto the battlefield with the same face up that was face up on the stack.
.rule{id: "section-712-13a"}
  .rule_id 712.13a
  .rule_text Some abilities may cause a transforming double-faced spell with its front face up on the stack to enter the battlefield transformed or converted. If the back face of the card that represents that spell is an instant or sorcery card, or that spell is a copy of a double-faced card created with an instant or sorcery back face, it doesn’t enter the battlefield, and is instead put into its owner’s graveyard.
  .rule_text Example: A player controls both Mycosynth Lattice and March of the Machines, the combined effects of which make all permanents artifact creatures in addition to their other types. They also control a Clone on the battlefield that is a copy of Bird Admirer, a creature with daybound. It is currently night, but that permanent can’t transform because it isn’t represented by a double-faced card. Its controller casts Mystic Reflection targeting it, then casts Invasion of Kylem, a Siege battle whose back face is a sorcery. Because Invasion of Kylem is entering the battlefield as a creature, Mystic Reflection’s replacement effect applies to it and it tries to enter the battlefield as a copy of Bird Admirer. Since it is night, the daybound ability would normally cause it to enter with its back face up. However, since its back face is a sorcery, it is instead put into its owner’s graveyard.
.rule{id: "section-712-14"}
  .rule_id 712.14.
  .rule_text A double-faced card put onto the battlefield from a zone other than the stack enters the battlefield with its front face up by default.
.rule{id: "section-712-14a"}
  .rule_id 712.14a
  .rule_text If a spell or ability puts a transforming double-faced card onto the battlefield “transformed” or “converted,” it enters the battlefield with its back face up. If a player is instructed to put a card that isn’t a transforming double-faced card onto the battlefield transformed or converted, that card stays in its current zone.
.rule{id: "section-712-14b"}
  .rule_id 712.14b
  .rule_text If a player is instructed to put a modal double-faced card onto the battlefield and its front face isn’t a permanent card, the card stays in its current zone.

.rule{id: "section-712-15"}
  .rule_id 712.15.
  .rule_text If an effect allows a player to cast a double-faced card as a face-down creature spell, or if a double-faced card enters the battlefield face down, it will have the characteristics given to it by the rule or effect that caused it to be face down. That card remains hidden, using a face-down substitute card (see rule <a href="#section-713">713</a>) and/or opaque sleeves. See rule <a href="#section-708">708</a>, “Face-Down Spells and Permanents.”
.rule{id: "section-712-15a"}
  .rule_id 712.15a

.rule{id: "section-712-16"}
  .rule_id 712.16.
  .rule_text Melded permanents and other double-faced permanents can’t be turned face down. If a spell or ability tries to turn a double-faced permanent face down, nothing happens.
.rule{id: "section-712-17"}
  .rule_id 712.17.
  .rule_text A double-faced card that is exiled face down remains hidden, using a face-down substitute card and/or opaque sleeves. See rule <a href="#section-713">713</a>, “Substitute Cards.”
.rule{id: "section-712-18"}
  .rule_id 712.18.
  .rule_text When a transforming double-faced permanent transforms or converts, it doesn’t become a new object. Any effects that applied to that permanent will continue to apply to it.
  .rule_text Example: An effect gives Village Ironsmith (the front face of a transforming double-faced card) +2/+2 until end of turn and then Village Ironsmith transforms into Ironfang. Ironfang will continue to get +2/+2 until end of turn.
.rule{id: "section-712-19"}
  .rule_id 712.19.
  .rule_text If an effect instructs a player to choose a card name, the player may choose the name of either face of a transforming or modal double-faced card but not both. Similarly, they may choose either the name of a front face of a meld card or the combined back face of a meld pair.
.rule{id: "section-712-20"}
  .rule_id 712.20.
  .rule_text If a transforming double-faced card would have an “As [this permanent] transforms . . .” ability after it transforms or converts, that ability is applied while that permanent is transforming or converting, not afterward.
.rule{id: "section-712-21"}
  .rule_id 712.21.
  .rule_text If a melded permanent leaves the battlefield, one permanent leaves the battlefield and two cards are put into the appropriate zone.
  .rule_text Example: Chittering Host, a melded permanent, dies. An ability that triggers “whenever a creature dies” triggers once. An ability that triggers “whenever a card is put into a graveyard from anywhere” triggers twice.
.rule{id: "section-712-21a"}
  .rule_id 712.21a
  .rule_text If a melded permanent is put into its owner’s graveyard or library, that player may arrange the two cards in any order. If it’s put into its owner’s library, that player doesn’t reveal the order.
.rule{id: "section-712-21b"}
  .rule_id 712.21b
  .rule_text If a player exiles a melded permanent, that player determines the relative timestamp order of the two cards at that time. This is an exception to the procedure described in rule <a href="#section-613-7m">613.7m</a>.
  .rule_text Example: Duplicant is a card with the abilities “When Duplicant enters the battlefield, you may exile target nontoken creature” and “As long as a card exiled with Duplicant is a creature card, Duplicant has the power, toughness, and creature types of the last creature card exiled with Duplicant. It’s still a Shapeshifter.” As Duplicant’s first ability exiles Chittering Host, a melded permanent, Duplicant’s controller chooses whether the last creature card exiled is Midnight Scavengers or Graf Rats.
.rule{id: "section-712-21c"}
  .rule_id 712.21c
  .rule_text If an effect can find the new object that a melded permanent becomes as it leaves the battlefield, it finds both cards. (See rule <a href="#section-400-7">400.7</a>.) If that effect causes actions to be taken upon those cards, the same actions are taken upon each of them.
  .rule_text Example: Otherworldly Journey is an instant that reads “Exile target creature. At the beginning of the next end step, return that card to the battlefield under its owner’s control with a +1/+1 counter on it.” A player casts Otherworldly Journey targeting Chittering Host, a melded permanent. Chittering Host is exiled. At the beginning of the next end step, Midnight Scavengers and Graf Rats are both returned to the battlefield, each with a +1/+1 counter on it.
  .rule_text Example: False Demise is an Aura with the ability “When enchanted creature dies, return that card to the battlefield under your control.” A Chittering Host enchanted by False Demise dies. The triggered ability returns both Midnight Scavengers and Graf Rats to the battlefield.
  .rule_text Example: Mimic Vat is an artifact that reads, in part, “Whenever a nontoken creature dies, you may exile that card.” A Chittering Host dies. As Mimic Vat’s triggered ability resolves, its controller makes a single choice and both cards that represented Chittering Host are either exiled or not.
.rule{id: "section-712-21d"}
  .rule_id 712.21d
  .rule_text If multiple replacement effects could be applied to the event of a melded permanent leaving the battlefield or being put into the new zone, applying one of those replacement effects to one of the two cards affects both cards. If the melded permanent is a commander, it may be exempt from this rule; see rules <a href="#section-903-9b">903.9b</a>–c.
  .rule_text Example: Leyline of the Void is an enchantment that reads, in part, “If a card would be put into an opponent’s graveyard from anywhere, exile it instead.” Wheel of Sun and Moon is an Aura with enchant player and the ability “If a card would be put into enchanted player’s graveyard from anywhere, instead that card is revealed and put on the bottom of its owner’s library.” If the controller of Chittering Host is affected by both cards’ effects, that player chooses one effect to apply to the event and Midnight Scavengers and Graf Rats are both moved to the appropriate zone.
.rule{id: "section-712-21e"}
  .rule_id 712.21e
  .rule_text If an effect needs to know the number of objects that changed zones, a melded permanent among those objects counts as one object that moved. If the effect needs to know the number of cards that changed zones, that melded permanent counts as two cards that moved.

.rule{id: "section-713-2"}
  .rule_id 713.2.
  .rule_text Each substitute card must clearly indicate the name of at least the front face of the card that it represents. Other information from the printed card (e.g. card type, mana cost, and power and toughness) may also be written on the substitute card.
.rule{id: "section-713-2a"}
  .rule_id 713.2a
  .rule_text Some substitute cards list the names and mana costs of the cards they can represent. Exactly one of the fill-in circles must be marked to denote which card the substitute card represents. This style of substitute card was found in Magic products that released 2011–2018.
.rule{id: "section-713-2b"}
  .rule_id 713.2b
  .rule_text Some substitute cards represent one specific listed card. This style of substitute card was found in the Core Set 2019 release, and it represents the card Nicol Bolas, the Ravager.
.rule{id: "section-713-2c"}
  .rule_id 713.2c
  .rule_text Some substitute cards can represent any modal double-faced card. These substitute cards include the front-face and back-face symbols on the front face of the card. To use one of them, write in the name of each face of the card it represents. This style of substitute card is found in the Zendikar Rising release.
.rule{id: "section-713-3"}
  .rule_id 713.3.
  .rule_text If a substitute card is used in a deck, the card it represents is set aside prior to the beginning of the game (see rule <a href="#section-103-2a">103.2a</a>) and must remain available throughout the game. A substitute card can’t be included in a deck unless it is representing a double-faced card or a meld card.

.rule{id: "section-714-4"}
  .rule_id 714.4.
  .rule_text If the number of lore counters on a Saga permanent is greater than or equal to its final chapter number, and it isn’t the source of a chapter ability that has triggered but not yet left the stack, that Saga’s controller sacrifices it. This state-based action doesn’t use the stack.

.rule{id: "section-715-2"}
  .rule_id 715.2.
  .rule_text The text that appears in the inset frame on the left defines alternative characteristics that the object may have while it’s a spell. The card’s normal characteristics appear as usual, although with a smaller text box on the right.
.rule{id: "section-715-2a"}
  .rule_id 715.2a
  .rule_text If an effect refers to a card, spell, or permanent that “has an Adventure,” it refers to an object for which these alternative characteristics exist, even if the object currently doesn’t use them.

  .rule_text The existence and values of these alternative characteristics is part of the object’s copiable values.
.rule{id: "section-715-2c"}
  .rule_id 715.2c
  .rule_text Although adventurer cards are printed with multiple sets of characteristics, each adventurer card is only one card. For example, a player who has drawn or discarded an adventurer card has drawn or discarded one card, not two.
.rule{id: "section-715-3"}
  .rule_id 715.3.
  .rule_text As a player casts an adventurer card, the player chooses whether they cast the card normally or as an Adventure.
.rule{id: "section-715-3a"}

  .rule_text While on the stack as an Adventure, the spell has only its alternative characteristics.
.rule{id: "section-715-3c"}
  .rule_id 715.3c
  .rule_text If an Adventure spell is copied, the copy is also an Adventure. It has the alternative characteristics of the spell and not the normal characteristics of the card that represents the Adventure spell. Any rule or effect that refers to a spell cast as an Adventure refers to the copy as well.
.rule{id: "section-715-3d"}
  .rule_id 715.3d
  .rule_text Instead of putting a spell that was cast as an Adventure into its owner’s graveyard as it resolves, its controller exiles it. For as long as that card remains exiled, that player may cast it. It can’t be cast as an Adventure this way, although other effects that allow a player to cast it may allow a player to cast it as an Adventure.
.rule{id: "section-715-4"}

.rule{id: "section-716-2"}
  .rule_id 716.2.
  .rule_text A class level bar is a keyword ability that represents both an activated ability and a static ability.

.rule{id: "section-716-2c"}
  .rule_id 716.2c
  .rule_text The phrase “to gain a Class level” means “to activate an ability indicated by a class level bar”
.rule{id: "section-716-2d"}
  .rule_id 716.2d
  .rule_text If a rule or effect refers to a permanent’s level and that permanent doesn’t have a level, it is treated as though its level is 1.
.rule{id: "section-716-3"}
  .rule_id 716.3.
  .rule_text Any ability printed on a Class card that isn’t preceded by a class level bar is treated normally. In particular, the Class has the ability printed in its top text box section at all times. That ability may affect the game if it’s a static ability, it may trigger if it’s a triggered ability, and it can be activated if it’s an activated ability.
.rule{id: "section-716-4"}
  .rule_id 716.4.
  .rule_text Some older creature cards, called leveler cards, have level up abilities that add level counters to them. These are not the same as class level abilities. Level counters do not interact with Class cards, and class levels do not interact with leveler cards.

  .rule_text Attraction is an artifact subtype seen only on nontraditional Magic cards. Each Attraction has an “Astrotorium” card back rather than a traditional Magic card back and has a column of circled numbers on the right side of its text box. Numbers in white text on a brightly colored background are said to be “lit up” on those cards. Note that multiple Attraction cards with the same English name may have different numbers lit up. You can see each Attraction card’s possible combinations of lights at Gatherer.Wizards.com.
.rule{id: "section-717-2"}
  .rule_id 717.2.
  .rule_text Attraction cards do not begin the game in a player’s deck and do not count toward maximum or minimum deck sizes. Rather, a player who chooses to play with Attraction cards begins the game with a supplementary Attraction deck that exists in the command zone. Each Attraction deck is shuffled before the game begins (see rule <a href="#section-103-3a">103.3a</a>).
.rule{id: "section-717-2a"}
  .rule_id 717.2a

See rules <a href="#section-703-4g">703.4g</a> and <a href="#section-701-49">701.49</a>, “Roll to Visit Your Attractions.” This turn-based action doesn’t use the stack.
.rule{id: "section-717-5"}
  .rule_id 717.5.
  .rule_text Each Attraction card has an ability that begins with the word “Visit” followed by a long dash in its rules text. This is a visit ability. A visit ability triggers whenever you roll to visit your Attractions and the result matches one of the lit-up numbers. See rule <a href="#section-702-159">702.159</a>, “Visit.”

.rule{id: "section-717-6a"}
  .rule_id 717.6a
  .rule_text Each card owned by the same player that has been put in the command zone this way is kept in a single face-up pile separate from any player’s Attraction deck. This pile is informally referred to as that player’s “junkyard.” The pile is not its own zone.

.rule{id: "section-718-2"}
  .rule_id 718.2.
  .rule_text The mana cost, power, and toughness in the inset frame represent alternative characteristics that the object may have while it is a spell or while it is a permanent on the battlefield. The card’s normal characteristics appear as usual.

.rule{id: "section-718-3c"}
  .rule_id 718.3c
  .rule_text If a prototyped spell is copied, the copy is also a prototyped spell. It has the alternative power, toughness, and mana cost characteristics of the spell and not the normal power, toughness, and mana cost characteristics of the card that represents the prototyped spell. Any rule or effect that refers to a prototyped spell refers to the copy as well.
.rule{id: "section-718-3d"}
  .rule_id 718.3d
  .rule_text If a permanent that was a prototyped spell is copied, the copy has the alternative power, toughness, and mana cost characteristics of the permanent and not the normal power and toughness characteristics of the card that represents that permanent.

  .rule_text If information about an object in the game would be visible to the player being controlled, it’s visible to both that player and the controller of the player. If information about cards outside the game would be visible to the player being controlled, it’s visible only to that player, not the controller of the player.
  .rule_text Example: The controller of a player can see that player’s hand and the face of any face-down creatures they control.
.rule{id: "section-719-5"}
  .rule_id 719.5.
  .rule_text While controlling another player, a player makes all choices and decisions the controlled player is allowed to make or is told to make by the rules or by any objects. This includes choices and decisions about what to play, and choices and decisions called for by spells and abilities.
  .rule_text Example: The controller of another player decides which spells that player casts and what those spells target, and makes any required decisions when those spells resolve.
  .rule_text Example: The controller of another player decides which of that player’s creatures attack, which player or planeswalker each one attacks, what the damage assignment order of the creatures that block them is (if any of the attacking creatures are blocked by multiple creatures), and how those attacking creatures assign their combat damage.
.rule{id: "section-719-5a"}
  .rule_id 719.5a
  .rule_text The controller of another player can use only that player’s resources (cards, mana, and so on) to pay costs for that player.
  .rule_text Example: If the controller of a player decides that the controlled player will cast a spell with an additional cost of discarding cards, the cards are discarded from the controlled player’s hand.
.rule{id: "section-719-5b"}
  .rule_id 719.5b
  .rule_text The controller of another player can’t make choices or decisions for that player that aren’t called for by the rules or by any objects. The controller also can’t make any choices or decisions for the player that would be called for by the tournament rules.

.rule{id: "section-719-6"}
  .rule_id 719.6.

  .rule_text Taking Shortcuts
.rule{id: "section-727-1"}
  .rule_id 727.1.
  .rule_text When playing a game, players typically make use of mutually understood shortcuts rather than explicitly identifying each game choice (either taking an action or passing priority) a player makes.
.rule{id: "section-727-1a"}
  .rule_id 727.1a
  .rule_text The rules for taking shortcuts are largely informal. As long as each player in the game understands the intent of each other player, any shortcut system they use is acceptable.
.rule{id: "section-727-1b"}
  .rule_id 727.1b
  .rule_text Occasionally the game gets into a state in which a set of actions could be repeated indefinitely (thus creating a “loop”). In that case, the shortcut rules can be used to determine how many times those actions are repeated without having to actually perform them, and how the loop is broken.
.rule{id: "section-727-1c"}
  .rule_id 727.1c
  .rule_text Tournaments use a modified version of the rules governing shortcuts and loops. These rules are covered in the Magic: The Gathering Tournament Rules (found at WPN.Wizards.com/en/resources/rules-documents). Whenever the Tournament Rules contradict these rules during a tournament, the Tournament Rules take precedence.
.rule{id: "section-727-2"}
  .rule_id 727.2.
  .rule_text Taking a shortcut follows the following procedure.
.rule{id: "section-727-2a"}
  .rule_id 727.2a
  .rule_text At any point in the game, the player with priority may suggest a shortcut by describing a sequence of game choices, for all players, that may be legally taken based on the current game state and the predictable results of the sequence of choices. This sequence may be a non-repetitive series of choices, a loop that repeats a specified number of times, multiple loops, or nested loops, and may even cross multiple turns. It can’t include conditional actions, where the outcome of a game event determines the next action a player takes. The ending point of this sequence must be a place where a player has priority, though it need not be the player proposing the shortcut.
  .rule_text Example: A player controls a creature enchanted by Presence of Gond, which grants the creature the ability “<span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-t"><span class="sr-only">{T}</span></span></span>: Create a 1/1 green Elf Warrior creature token,” and another player controls Intruder Alarm, which reads, in part, “Whenever a creature enters the battlefield, untap all creatures.” When the player has priority, they may suggest “I’ll create a million tokens,” indicating the sequence of activating the creature’s ability, all players passing priority, letting the creature’s ability resolve and create a token (which causes Intruder Alarm’s ability to trigger), Intruder Alarm’s controller putting that triggered ability on the stack, all players passing priority, Intruder Alarm’s triggered ability resolving, all players passing priority until the player proposing the shortcut has priority, and repeating that sequence <a href="#section-999">999</a>,<a href="#section-999">999</a> more times, ending just after the last token-creating ability resolves.
.rule{id: "section-727-2b"}
  .rule_id 727.2b
  .rule_text Each other player, in turn order starting after the player who suggested the shortcut, may either accept the proposed sequence, or shorten it by naming a place where they will make a game choice that’s different than what’s been proposed. (The player doesn’t need to specify at this time what the new choice will be.) This place becomes the new ending point of the proposed sequence.
  .rule_text Example: The active player draws a card during her draw step, then says, “Go.” The nonactive player is holding Into the Fray (an instant that says “Target creature attacks this turn if able”) and says, “I’d like to cast a spell during your beginning of combat step.” The current proposed shortcut is that all players pass priority at all opportunities during the turn until the nonactive player has priority during the beginning of combat step.
.rule{id: "section-727-2c"}
  .rule_id 727.2c
  .rule_text Once the last player has either accepted or shortened the shortcut proposal, the shortcut is taken. The game advances to the last proposed ending point, with all game choices contained in the shortcut proposal having been taken. If the shortcut was shortened from the original proposal, the player who now has priority must make a different game choice than what was originally proposed for that player.
.rule{id: "section-727-3"}
  .rule_id 727.3.
  .rule_text Sometimes a loop can be fragmented, meaning that each player involved in the loop performs an independent action that results in the same game state being reached multiple times. If that happens, the active player (or, if the active player is not involved in the loop, the first player in turn order who is involved) must then make a different game choice so the loop does not continue.
  .rule_text Example: In a two-player game, the active player controls a creature with the ability “<span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-0"><span class="sr-only">{0}</span></span></span>: [This creature] gains flying,” the nonactive player controls a permanent with the ability “<span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-0"><span class="sr-only">{0}</span></span></span>: Target creature loses flying,” and nothing in the game cares how many times an ability has been activated. Say the active player activates his creature’s ability, it resolves, then the nonactive player activates her permanent’s ability targeting that creature, and it resolves. This returns the game to a game state it was at before. The active player must make a different game choice (in other words, anything other than activating that creature’s ability again). The creature doesn’t have flying. Note that the nonactive player could have prevented the fragmented loop simply by not activating her permanent’s ability, in which case the creature would have had flying. The nonactive player always has the final choice and is therefore able to determine whether the creature has flying.
.rule{id: "section-727-4"}
  .rule_id 727.4.
  .rule_text If a loop contains only mandatory actions, the game is a draw. (See rules <a href="#section-104-4b">104.4b</a> and <a href="#section-104-4f">104.4f</a>.)
.rule{id: "section-727-5"}
  .rule_id 727.5.
  .rule_text No player can be forced to perform an action that would end a loop other than actions called for by objects involved in the loop.
  .rule_text Example: A player controls Seal of Cleansing, an enchantment that reads, “Sacrifice Seal of Cleansing: Destroy target artifact or enchantment.” A mandatory loop that involves an artifact begins. The player is not forced to sacrifice Seal of Cleansing to destroy the artifact and end the loop.
.rule{id: "section-727-6"}
  .rule_id 727.6.
  .rule_text If a loop contains an effect that says “[A] unless [B],” where [A] and [B] are each actions, no player can be forced to perform [B] to break the loop. If no player chooses to perform [B], the loop will continue as though [A] were mandatory.

  .rule_id 728.
  .rule_text Handling Illegal Actions
.rule{id: "section-728-1"}
  .rule_id 728.1.
  .rule_text If a player takes an illegal action or starts to take an action but can’t legally complete it, the entire action is reversed and any payments already made are canceled. No abilities trigger and no effects apply as a result of an undone action. If the action was casting a spell, the spell returns to the zone it came from. Each player may also reverse any legal mana abilities that player activated while making the illegal play, unless mana from those abilities or from any triggered mana abilities they caused to trigger was spent on another mana ability that wasn’t reversed. Players may not reverse actions that moved cards to a library, moved cards from a library to any zone other than the stack, caused a library to be shuffled, or caused cards from a library to be revealed.
.rule{id: "section-728-2"}
  .rule_id 728.2.
  .rule_text When reversing illegal spells and abilities, the player who had priority retains it and may take another action or pass. The player may redo the reversed action in a legal way or take any other action allowed by the rules.

  .rule_text General
.rule{id: "section-800-1"}
  .rule_id 800.1.
  .rule_text A multiplayer game is a game that begins with more than two players. This section contains additional optional rules that can be used for multiplayer play.
.rule{id: "section-800-2"}
  .rule_id 800.2.
  .rule_text These rules consist of a series of options that can be added to a multiplayer game and a number of variant styles of multiplayer play. A single game may use multiple options but only one variant.
.rule{id: "section-800-3"}
  .rule_id 800.3.
  .rule_text Many multiplayer Magic tournaments have additional rules not included here, including rules for deck construction. See the most current Magic: The Gathering Tournament Rules for more information. They can be found at WPN.Wizards.com/en/resources/rules-documents.

  .rule_id 800.4.
  .rule_text Unlike two-player games, multiplayer games can continue after one or more players have left the game.
.rule{id: "section-800-4a"}
  .rule_id 800.4a
  .rule_text When a player leaves the game, all objects (see rule <a href="#section-109">109</a>) owned by that player leave the game and any effects which give that player control of any objects or players end. Then, if that player controlled any objects on the stack not represented by cards, those objects cease to exist. Then, if there are any objects still controlled by that player, those objects are exiled. This is not a state-based action. It happens as soon as the player leaves the game. If the player who left the game had priority at the time they left, priority passes to the next player in turn order who’s still in the game.
  .rule_text Example: Alex casts Mind Control, an Aura that reads, “You control enchanted creature,” on Bianca’s Assault Griffin. If Alex leaves the game, so does Mind Control, and Assault Griffin reverts to Bianca’s control. If, instead, Bianca leaves the game, so does Assault Griffin, and Mind Control is put into Alex’s graveyard.
  .rule_text Example: Alex casts Act of Treason, which reads, in part, “Gain control of target creature until end of turn,” targeting Bianca’s Runeclaw Bears. If Alex leaves the game, Act of Treason’s change-of-control effect ends and Runeclaw Bears reverts to Bianca’s control.
  .rule_text Example: Alex casts Bribery, which reads, “Search target opponent’s library for a creature card and put that card onto the battlefield under your control. Then that player shuffles their library,” targeting Bianca. Alex puts Serra Angel onto the battlefield from Bianca’s library. If Bianca leaves the game, Serra Angel also leaves the game. If, instead, Alex leaves the game, Serra Angel is exiled.
  .rule_text Example: Alex controls Genesis Chamber, which reads, “Whenever a nontoken creature enters the battlefield, if Genesis Chamber is untapped, that creature’s controller creates a 1/1 colorless Myr artifact creature token.” If Alex leaves the game, all such Myr tokens that entered the battlefield under Alex’s control leave the game, and all such Myr tokens that entered the battlefield under any other player’s control remain in the game.
.rule{id: "section-800-4b"}
  .rule_id 800.4b
  .rule_text If an object would change to the control of a player who has left the game, it doesn’t. If a token would be created under the control of a player who has left the game, no token is created. If an object would be put onto the battlefield or onto the stack under the control of a player who has left the game, that object remains in its current zone. If a player would be controlled by a player who has left the game, they aren’t.
.rule{id: "section-800-4c"}
  .rule_id 800.4c
  .rule_text If an effect that gives a player still in the game control of an object ends, there is no other effect giving control of that object to another player in the game, and the player who controlled that object by default has left the game, the object is exiled. This is not a state-based action. It happens as soon as the control-changing effect ends.
.rule{id: "section-800-4d"}
  .rule_id 800.4d
  .rule_text If an object that would be owned by a player who has left the game would be created in any zone, it isn’t created. If a triggered ability that would be controlled by a player who has left the game would be put onto the stack, it isn’t put on the stack.
  .rule_text Example: Astral Slide is an enchantment that reads, “Whenever a player cycles a card, you may exile target creature. If you do, return that creature to the battlefield under its owner’s control at the beginning of the next end step.” During Alex’s turn, Bianca uses Astral Slide’s ability to exile Alex’s Hypnotic Specter. Before the end of that turn, Bianca leaves the game. At the beginning of the end step, the delayed triggered ability generated by Astral Slide that would return Hypnotic Specter to the battlefield triggers, but it isn’t put on the stack. Hypnotic Specter never returns to the battlefield.
.rule{id: "section-800-4e"}
  .rule_id 800.4e
  .rule_text If combat damage would be assigned to a player who has left the game, that damage isn’t assigned.
.rule{id: "section-800-4f"}
  .rule_id 800.4f
  .rule_text If an object requires a player who has left the game to pay a cost or choose whether to pay a cost, that cost is not paid.
.rule{id: "section-800-4g"}
  .rule_id 800.4g
  .rule_text If an object requires a player who has left the game to make a choice other than whether to pay a cost, the controller of the object chooses another player to make that choice. If the original choice was to be made by an opponent of the controller of the object, that player chooses another opponent if possible.
.rule{id: "section-800-4h"}
  .rule_id 800.4h
  .rule_text If a rule requires a player who has left the game to make a choice, the next player in turn order makes that choice.
.rule{id: "section-800-4i"}
  .rule_id 800.4i
  .rule_text If an effect requires information about a specific player, the effect uses the current information about that player if they are still in the game; otherwise, the effect uses the last known information about that player before they left the game. If an effect requires information from the game about actions players have taken, the effect can find actions that were taken by a player who has left the game.
.rule{id: "section-800-4j"}
  .rule_id 800.4j
  .rule_text If a player leaves the game during their turn, that turn continues to its completion without an active player. If the active player would receive priority, instead the next player in turn order receives priority, or the top object on the stack resolves, or the phase or step ends, whichever is appropriate.
.rule{id: "section-800-4k"}
  .rule_id 800.4k
  .rule_text If a player who has left the game would begin a turn, that turn doesn’t begin.
.rule{id: "section-800-4m"}
  .rule_id 800.4m
  .rule_text When a player leaves the game, any continuous effects with durations that last until that player’s next turn or until a specific point in that turn will last until that turn would have begun. They neither expire immediately nor last indefinitely.
.rule{id: "section-800-4n"}
  .rule_id 800.4n
  .rule_text When a player leaves the game, objects that player owns in the ante zone do not leave the game. This is an exception to rule <a href="#section-800-4a">800.4a</a>. See rule <a href="#section-407">407</a>, “Ante.”
.rule{id: "section-800-4p"}
  .rule_id 800.4p
  .rule_text In a Planechase game, if the player designated as the planar controller would leave the game, instead the next player in turn order that wouldn’t leave the game becomes the planar controller, then the old planar controller leaves the game. See rule <a href="#section-311-5">311.5</a>.
.rule{id: "section-800-5"}
  .rule_id 800.5.
  .rule_text Unless a chosen variant or option prescribes otherwise, seating order is determined by any mutually agreeable method. For example, players could agree to remain where they were before the game began, roll dice to determine seating order, and so on.
.rule{id: "section-800-6"}
  .rule_id 800.6.
  .rule_text In a multiplayer game, the first mulligan a player takes doesn’t count toward the number of cards that player will put on the bottom of their library or the number of mulligans that player may take. Subsequent mulligans are counted toward these numbers as normal.
.rule{id: "section-800-7"}
  .rule_id 800.7.
  .rule_text In a multiplayer game other than a Two-Headed Giant game, the starting player doesn’t skip the draw step of their first turn. In a Two-Headed Giant game, the team who plays first skips the draw step of their first turn. See rule <a href="#section-103-8">103.8</a>.

  .rule_id 801.
  .rule_text Limited Range of Influence Option
.rule{id: "section-801-1"}
  .rule_id 801.1.
  .rule_text Limited range of influence is an option that can be applied to most multiplayer games. It’s always used in the Emperor variant (see rule <a href="#section-809">809</a>), and it’s often used for games involving five or more players.
.rule{id: "section-801-2"}
  .rule_id 801.2.
  .rule_text A player’s range of influence is the maximum distance from that player, measured in player seats, that the player can affect. Players within that many seats of the player are within that player’s range of influence. Objects controlled by players within a player’s range of influence are also within that player’s range of influence. Range of influence covers spells, abilities, effects, damage dealing, attacking, making choices, and winning the game.
.rule{id: "section-801-2a"}
  .rule_id 801.2a
  .rule_text The most commonly chosen limited ranges of influence are 1 seat and 2 seats. Different players may have different ranges of influence.
  .rule_text Example: A range of influence of 1 means that only you and the players seated directly next to you are within your range of influence.
  .rule_text Example: A range of influence of 2 means that you and the two players to your left and the two players to your right are within your range of influence.
.rule{id: "section-801-2b"}
  .rule_id 801.2b
  .rule_text A player is always within their own range of influence.
.rule{id: "section-801-2c"}
  .rule_id 801.2c
  .rule_text The particular players within each player’s range of influence are determined as each turn begins.
  .rule_text Example: In a game with a range of influence of 1, Alex is seated to the left of Rob, and Carissa is seated to the right of Rob. Carissa is not in Alex’s range of influence. If Rob leaves the game, Carissa will enter Alex’s range of influence at the start of the next turn.
.rule{id: "section-801-2d"}
  .rule_id 801.2d
  .rule_text An object is within a player’s range of influence if it’s controlled by that player or by another player within that many seats of that player. In addition, a battle is within a player’s range of influence if it’s protected by that player or by another player within that many seats of that player.
.rule{id: "section-801-3"}
  .rule_id 801.3.
  .rule_text Creatures can attack only opponents within their controller’s range of influence, planeswalkers controlled by those opponents, and battles protected by those opponents. If no opponents are within a player’s range of influence, creatures that player controls can’t attack.
.rule{id: "section-801-4"}
  .rule_id 801.4.
  .rule_text Objects and players outside a player’s range of influence can’t be the targets of spells or abilities that player controls.
.rule{id: "section-801-5"}
  .rule_id 801.5.
  .rule_text Some cards require players to make choices. These cards work differently when the limited range of influence option is used.
.rule{id: "section-801-5a"}
  .rule_id 801.5a
  .rule_text If a player is asked to choose an object or player, they must choose one within their range of influence.
  .rule_text Example: In a game with a range of influence of 1, Alex is seated to the left of Rob. Alex activates the ability of Cuombajj Witches, which reads, “<span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-t"><span class="sr-only">{T}</span></span></span>: Cuombajj Witches deals 1 damage to any target and 1 damage to any target of an opponent’s choice,” targeting Rob and choosing Rob as the opponent who picks the other target. Rob must choose a target that’s in both his range of influence and in the range of influence of the controller of Cuombajj Witches. He must therefore choose himself, Alex, or a creature controlled by either himself or Alex.
.rule{id: "section-801-5b"}
  .rule_id 801.5b
  .rule_text If a player is asked to choose between one or more options (and not between one or more objects or players), they can choose between those options even if those options refer to objects or players outside the player’s range of influence.
  .rule_text Example: Alex, who has a range of influence of 2, is seated to the left of Rob, and Carissa, who has a range of influence of 1, is seated to the right of Rob. Alex casts a spell that reads, “An opponent chooses one — You draw two cards; or each creature you control gets +2/+2 until end of turn,” and chooses Carissa to make that choice. Carissa can choose the mode even though Alex is out of her range.
.rule{id: "section-801-5c"}
  .rule_id 801.5c
  .rule_text If an effect requires a choice and there’s no player who can make that choice within its controller’s range of influence, the closest appropriate player to its controller’s left makes that choice.
  .rule_text Example: In an Emperor game in which all players have range of influence 1, an emperor casts Fact or Fiction, which reads, “Reveal the top five cards of your library. An opponent separates those cards into two piles. Put one pile into your hand and the other into your graveyard.” Since no opponent is within the emperor’s range of influence, the nearest opponent to the emperor’s left separates the cards into piles.
.rule{id: "section-801-6"}
  .rule_id 801.6.
  .rule_text A player can’t activate the activated abilities of an object outside of their range of influence.
.rule{id: "section-801-7"}
  .rule_id 801.7.
  .rule_text A triggered ability doesn’t trigger unless its trigger event happens entirely within the range of influence of its source’s controller.
  .rule_text Example: In a game in which all players have range of influence 1, Alex is seated to the left of Rob. Rob controls two Auras attached to Alex’s Runeclaw Bear: One with the trigger condition “Whenever enchanted creature becomes blocked,” and one with the trigger condition “Whenever enchanted creature becomes blocked by a creature.” Alex’s Runeclaw Bear attacks the player to Alex’s left and becomes blocked. The ability of Rob’s first Aura triggers because the entire event (Runeclaw Bear becomes blocked) happens within Rob’s range of influence. The ability of Rob’s second Aura doesn’t trigger, however, because that event includes the blocking creature, which is out of Rob’s range.
.rule{id: "section-801-7a"}
  .rule_id 801.7a
  .rule_text If a trigger event includes an object moving out of or into a player’s range of influence, use the game state before or after the event as appropriate to determine whether the triggered ability will trigger. See rules <a href="#section-603-6">603.6</a> and <a href="#section-603-10">603.10</a>.
  .rule_text Example: Carissa and Alex are outside each other’s range of influence. Carissa controls a Runeclaw Bear owned by Alex and they each control an Extractor Demon, a creature which reads, in part, “Whenever another creature leaves the battlefield, you may have target player mill two cards.” The Runeclaw Bear is destroyed and is put into Alex’s graveyard. The ability of Alex’s Extractor Demon doesn’t trigger because the leaves-the-battlefield event was outside Alex’s range of influence. The ability of Carissa’s Extractor Demon does trigger, even though the creature is going to a graveyard outside her range, because the leaves-the-battlefield event was within her range.
.rule{id: "section-801-8"}
  .rule_id 801.8.
  .rule_text An Aura can’t enchant an object or player outside its controller’s range of influence. If an Aura is attached to an illegal object or player, the Aura is put into its owner’s graveyard as a state-based action. See rule <a href="#section-704">704</a>.
.rule{id: "section-801-9"}
  .rule_id 801.9.
  .rule_text An Equipment can’t equip an object outside its controller’s range of influence, and a Fortification can’t fortify an object outside its controller’s range of influence. If an Equipment or Fortification is attached to an illegal permanent, it becomes unattached from that permanent but remains on the battlefield. This is a state-based action. See rule <a href="#section-704">704</a>.
.rule{id: "section-801-10"}
  .rule_id 801.10.
  .rule_text Spells and abilities can’t affect objects or players outside their controller’s range of influence. The parts of the effect that attempt to affect an out-of-range object or player will do nothing. The rest of the effect will work normally.
  .rule_text Example: In a six-player game in which each player has range of influence 1, Alex casts Pyroclasm, which reads, “Pyroclasm deals 2 damage to each creature.” Pyroclasm deals 2 damage to each creature controlled by Alex, the player to Alex’s left, and the player to Alex’s right. No other creatures are dealt damage.
.rule{id: "section-801-11"}
  .rule_id 801.11.
  .rule_text If a spell or ability requires information from the game, it gets only information from within its controller’s range of influence. It doesn’t see objects or events outside its controller’s range of influence.
  .rule_text Example: In a six-player game where each player has range of influence 1, Alex controls Coat of Arms, which reads, “Each creature gets +1/+1 for each other creature on the battlefield that shares at least one creature type with it.” Coat of Arms will boost Alex’s creatures based only on what creatures are controlled by Alex, the player to Alex’s left, and the player to Alex’s right. It won’t take other creatures into account.
  .rule_text Example: In the same game, Rob is sitting to the right of Alex. Coat of Arms will boost Rob’s creatures based on what creatures are controlled by players within Alex’s range of influence, including the player sitting to Alex’s left, who’s out of Rob’s range of influence.
.rule{id: "section-801-12"}
  .rule_id 801.12.
  .rule_text The “world rule” (see rule <a href="#section-704-5k">704.5k</a>) applies to a permanent only if other world permanents are within its controller’s range of influence.
.rule{id: "section-801-13"}
  .rule_id 801.13.
  .rule_text Replacement and prevention effects watch for a particular event to happen and then completely or partially replace that event. The limited range of influence option can cause the modified event to contain instructions that can’t be carried out, in which case the player simply ignores the impossible instructions. See rule <a href="#section-614">614</a>, “Replacement Effects,” and rule <a href="#section-615">615</a>, “Prevention Effects.”
.rule{id: "section-801-13a"}
  .rule_id 801.13a
  .rule_text If a replacement effect tries to cause a spell or ability to affect an object or player outside its controller’s range of influence, that portion of the event does nothing.
  .rule_text Example: Alex casts Lava Axe (“Lava Axe deals 5 damage to target player or planeswalker.”) targeting Rob. In response, Rob casts Captain’s Maneuver (“The next X damage that would be dealt to target creature, planeswalker, or player this turn is dealt to another target creature, planeswalker, or player instead.”) with X equal to 3, targeting Carissa. Carissa isn’t in Alex’s range of influence. When Lava Axe resolves, it deals 2 damage to Rob and no damage to Carissa.
.rule{id: "section-801-13b"}
  .rule_id 801.13b
  .rule_text If a spell or ability creates an effect that prevents damage that would be dealt by a source, it can affect only sources within the spell or ability’s controller’s range of influence. If a spell or ability creates an effect that prevents damage that would be dealt to a permanent or player, it can affect only permanents and players within the spell or ability’s controller’s range of influence. If a spell or ability creates an effect that prevents damage, but neither the source nor the would-be recipient of the damage is specified, it prevents damage only if both the source and recipient of that damage are within the spell or ability’s controller’s range of influence.
  .rule_text Example: Rob is within Alex’s range of influence, but Carissa is not. Alex controls an enchantment that says, “Prevent all damage that would be dealt by creatures.” Carissa attacks Rob with a creature. The creature deals combat damage to Rob.
  .rule_text Example: Rob is within Alex’s range of influence, but Carissa is not. Carissa casts Lightning Blast (“Lightning Blast deals 4 damage to any target.”) targeting Rob. In response, Alex casts Mending Hands (“Prevent the next 4 damage that would be dealt to any target this turn.”) targeting Rob. The damage to Rob is prevented.
  .rule_text Example: Rob is within Alex’s range of influence, but Carissa is not. Carissa attacks Rob with a creature, and Rob blocks with a creature. Alex casts Fog (“Prevent all combat damage that would be dealt this turn.”) Carissa and Rob’s creatures deal combat damage to each other.
.rule{id: "section-801-14"}
  .rule_id 801.14.
  .rule_text If an effect states that a player wins the game, all of that player’s opponents within that player’s range of influence lose the game instead.
.rule{id: "section-801-15"}
  .rule_id 801.15.
  .rule_text If the effect of a spell or ability states that the game is a draw, the game is a draw for that spell or ability’s controller and all players within that player’s range of influence. They leave the game. All remaining players continue to play the game.
.rule{id: "section-801-16"}
  .rule_id 801.16.
  .rule_text If the game somehow enters a “loop” of mandatory actions, repeating a sequence of events with no way to stop, the game is a draw for each player who controls an object that’s involved in that loop, as well as for each player within the range of influence of any of those players. They leave the game. All remaining players continue to play the game.
.rule{id: "section-801-17"}
  .rule_id 801.17.
  .rule_text Effects that restart the game (see rule <a href="#section-723">723</a>) are exempt from the limited range of influence option. All players in the game will be involved in the new game.
.rule{id: "section-801-18"}
  .rule_id 801.18.
  .rule_text In multiplayer Planechase games other than Grand Melee games, plane cards and phenomenon cards are exempt from the limited range of influence option. Their abilities, and the effects of those abilities, affect all applicable objects and players in the game. See rule <a href="#section-901">901</a>, “Planechase.”
.rule{id: "section-802"}
  .rule_id 802.
  .rule_text Attack Multiple Players Option
.rule{id: "section-802-1"}
  .rule_id 802.1.
  .rule_text Some multiplayer games allow the active player to attack multiple other players. If this option is used, a player can also choose to attack only one player during a particular combat.
.rule{id: "section-802-2"}
  .rule_id 802.2.
  .rule_text As the combat phase starts, the attacking player doesn’t choose an opponent to become the defending player. Instead, all the attacking player’s opponents are defending players during the combat phase.
.rule{id: "section-802-2a"}
  .rule_id 802.2a
  .rule_text Any rule, object, or effect that refers to a “defending player” refers to one specific defending player, not to all of the defending players. If an ability of an attacking creature refers to a defending player, or a spell or ability refers to both an attacking creature and a defending player, then unless otherwise specified, the defending player it’s referring to is the player that creature is attacking, the controller of the planeswalker that creature is attacking, or the protector of the battle that player is attacking. If that creature is no longer attacking, the defending player it’s referring to is the player that creature was attacking before it was removed from combat, the controller of the planeswalker that creature was attacking before it was removed from combat, or the protector of the battle that player was attacking before it was removed from combat. If a spell or ability could apply to multiple attacking creatures, the appropriate defending player is individually determined for each of those attacking creatures. If there are multiple defending players that could be chosen, the controller of the spell or ability chooses one.
  .rule_text Example: Rob attacks Alex with Runeclaw Bear and attacks Carissa with a creature with mountainwalk. Whether the creature with mountainwalk can be blocked depends only on whether Carissa controls a Mountain.
.rule{id: "section-802-3"}
  .rule_id 802.3.
  .rule_text As the attacking player declares each attacking creature, they choose a defending player, a planeswalker controlled by a defending player, or a battle protected by a defending player for it to attack. See rule <a href="#section-508">508</a>, “Declare Attackers Step.”

If an ability of a blocking creature refers to an attacking player, or a spell or ability refers to both a blocking creature and an attacking player, then unless otherwise specified, the attacking player it’s referring to is the player who controls the attacking creature that blocking creature is blocking. If a spell or ability could apply to multiple blocking creatures, the appropriate attacking player is individually determined for each of those blocking creatures. If there are multiple attacking players that could be chosen, the controller of the spell or ability chooses one.

If an ability of an attacking creature refers to a defending player, or a spell or ability refers to both an attacking creature and a defending player, then unless otherwise specified, the defending player it’s referring to is the player that creature is attacking, the controller of the planeswalker that creature is attacking, or the protector of the battle that creature is attacking. If that creature is no longer attacking, the defending player it’s referring to is the player that creature was attacking before it was removed from combat, the controller of the planeswalker that creature was attacking before it was removed from combat, or the protector of the battle that creature was attacking before it was removed from combat. If a spell or ability could apply to multiple attacking creatures, the appropriate defending player is individually determined for each of those attacking creatures. If there are multiple defending players that could be chosen, the controller of the spell or ability chooses one.

.rule{id: "section-807-4a"}
  .rule_id 807.4a
  .rule_text There is one turn marker for each full four players in the game.
  .rule_text Example: A Grand Melee game with sixteen players has four turn markers. A game with fifteen players has three turn markers.
.rule{id: "section-807-4b"}
  .rule_id 807.4b
  .rule_text The starting player in the game gets the first turn marker. The player four seats to that player’s left (the fifth player) takes the second turn marker, and so on until all the turn markers have been handed out. Each turn marker is assigned a number in this way. Then all players with turn markers start their turns at the same time.
.rule{id: "section-807-4c"}
  .rule_id 807.4c
  .rule_text After a player ends their turn, that player passes the turn marker to the player on their left. If a player with a turn marker leaves the game during their turn, the player to their left takes the turn marker after that turn ends. If a player with a turn marker leaves the game before their turn begins, the player to their left takes the turn marker immediately.
.rule{id: "section-807-4d"}
  .rule_id 807.4d
  .rule_text A player who receives a turn marker can’t begin their turn if any player in the three seats to their left has a turn marker. If this is the case, that player waits until the player four seats to their left takes the other turn marker.
.rule{id: "section-807-4e"}
  .rule_id 807.4e
  .rule_text If a player leaves the game and that player leaving the game would reduce the number of turn markers in the game, the turn marker immediately to the departed player’s right is designated for removal. If more than one player leaves the game simultaneously, those players leaving the game would reduce the number of turn markers in the game, and there are multiple turn markers that could be removed, the marker with the lowest number is designated for removal. A turn marker may be designated for removal multiple times.
.rule{id: "section-807-4f"}
  .rule_id 807.4f
  .rule_text For the purposes of determining if one or more players leaving the game would reduce the number of turn markers in the game (see rule <a href="#section-807-4e">807.4e</a>), disregard turn markers already designated for removal.
.rule{id: "section-807-4g"}
  .rule_id 807.4g
  .rule_text If a player who’s taking a turn has a turn marker that’s been designated for removal, that turn marker is removed rather than being passed after that turn ends. If a player who’s not taking a turn has a turn marker that’s been designated for removal, that turn marker is removed immediately. If a removed turn marker had been designated for removal multiple times, the turn marker to its right becomes designated for removal that many times minus one.
.rule{id: "section-807-4h"}
  .rule_id 807.4h
  .rule_text If one or more consecutively seated players leave the game, the players that were on either side of those seats don’t enter one another’s range of influence until the next turn begins.
.rule{id: "section-807-4i"}
  .rule_id 807.4i
  .rule_text If an effect causes a player with a turn marker to take an extra turn after the current one, that player keeps the turn marker and starts their next turn after the current turn ends, unless another turn marker is too close on either side at that time. If a turn marker is within three seats on the player’s left, the extra turn waits to begin until the player four seats to their left takes the other turn marker. If a turn marker is within three seats on the player’s right, the player passes the turn marker to their left when the turn ends rather than keeping it, and the player will take the extra turn immediately before their next turn.
.rule{id: "section-807-4j"}
  .rule_id 807.4j
  .rule_text If an effect would cause a player to take an extra turn after the current turn, but that player wouldn’t have a turn marker at the start of that turn, that player will take the extra turn immediately before their next turn instead.
  .rule_text Example: During Alex’s turn, he casts Time Walk, which causes him to take an extra turn after this one. During the same turn, the player to Alex’s left leaves the game, which causes the number of turn markers to be reduced. After Alex’s current turn ends, his turn marker is removed. He won’t take the extra turn from Time Walk until just before his normal turn the next time he receives a turn marker.
.rule{id: "section-807-5"}
  .rule_id 807.5.
  .rule_text Rather than having a single stack, Grand Melee games contain multiple stacks. Each turn marker represents its own stack.
.rule{id: "section-807-5a"}
  .rule_id 807.5a
  .rule_text A player gets priority for a particular turn marker’s stack only if the turn marker is within their range of influence or an object on that stack is controlled by a player within their range of influence.
.rule{id: "section-807-5b"}
  .rule_id 807.5b
  .rule_text If a player has priority for multiple stacks and casts a spell, activates an ability, or a triggered ability they control triggers, the player must specify which one of those stacks the spell or ability is put on. If an object on one of those stacks caused the triggered ability to trigger, the player must put it on that stack. If a resolving spell or ability on one of those stacks causes a player to cast a spell or create a copy of a spell, the new spell must be put on the same stack. If a spell or ability targets an object on one of those stacks, it must be put on the same stack as its target; it can’t target objects on multiple stacks.

  .rule_id 810.5.
  .rule_text With the exception of life total and poison counters, a team’s resources (cards in hand, mana, and so on) are not shared in the Two-Headed Giant variant.

  .rule_id 810.7.
  .rule_text The Two-Headed Giant variant uses the combat rules for the shared team turns option (see rule <a href="#section-805-10">805.10</a>). This is a change from previous rules.
.rule{id: "section-810-8"}
  .rule_id 810.8.
  .rule_text The Two-Headed Giant variant uses the normal rules for winning or losing the game (see rule <a href="#section-104">104</a>), with the following additions and specifications.
.rule{id: "section-810-8a"}
  .rule_id 810.8a
  .rule_text Players win and lose the game only as a team, not as individuals. If either player on a team loses the game, the team loses the game. If either player on a team wins the game, the entire team wins the game. If an effect says that a player can’t win the game, that player’s team can’t win the game. If an effect says that a player can’t lose the game, that player’s team can’t lose the game.
  .rule_text Example: In a Two-Headed Giant game, a player controls Transcendence, which reads, in part, “You don’t lose the game for having 0 or less life.” If that player’s team’s life total is 0 or less, that team doesn’t lose the game.
  .rule_text Example: In a Two-Headed Giant game, a player attempts to draw a card while there are no cards in that player’s library. That player loses the game, so that player’s entire team loses the game.
  .rule_text Example: In a Two-Headed Giant game, a player controls Platinum Angel, which reads, “You can’t lose the game and your opponents can’t win the game.” Neither that player nor their teammate can lose the game while Platinum Angel is on the battlefield, and neither player on the opposing team can win the game.
.rule{id: "section-810-8b"}
  .rule_id 810.8b
  .rule_text If a player concedes, their team leaves the game immediately. That team loses the game.
.rule{id: "section-810-8c"}
  .rule_id 810.8c
  .rule_text If a team’s life total is 0 or less, the team loses the game. (This is a state-based action. See rule <a href="#section-704">704</a>.)
.rule{id: "section-810-8d"}
  .rule_id 810.8d
  .rule_text If a team has fifteen or more poison counters, that team loses the game. (This is a state-based action. See rule <a href="#section-704">704</a>.)
.rule{id: "section-810-9"}
  .rule_id 810.9.
  .rule_text Damage, loss of life, and gaining life happen to each player individually. The result is applied to the team’s shared life total.
  .rule_text Example: In a Two-Headed Giant game, a player casts Flame Rift, which reads, “Flame Rift deals 4 damage to each player.” Each team is dealt a total of 8 damage.
.rule{id: "section-810-9a"}
  .rule_id 810.9a
  .rule_text If a cost or effect needs to know the value of an individual player’s life total, that cost or effect uses the team’s life total instead.
  .rule_text Example: In a Two-Headed Giant game, a player on a team that has 17 life is targeted by Beacon of Immortality, which reads, in part, “Double target player’s life total.” That player gains 17 life, so the team winds up at 34 life.
  .rule_text Example: In a Two-Headed Giant game, a player controls Test of Endurance, an enchantment that reads, “At the beginning of your upkeep, if you have 50 or more life, you win the game.” At the beginning of that player’s upkeep, the player’s team wins the game if their team’s life total is 50 or more.
  .rule_text Example: In a Two-Headed Giant game, a player on a team that has 11 life controls Lurking Evil, an enchantment that reads, “Pay half your life, rounded up: Lurking Evil becomes a 4/4 Horror creature with flying.” To activate the ability, that player must pay 6 life. The team winds up at 5 life.
.rule{id: "section-810-9b"}
  .rule_id 810.9b
  .rule_text If a cost or effect allows both members of a team to pay life simultaneously, the total amount of life they pay may not exceed their team’s life total. (Players can always pay 0 life.)
.rule{id: "section-810-9c"}
  .rule_id 810.9c
  .rule_text If an effect sets a single player’s life total to a specific number, the player gains or loses the necessary amount of life to end up with the new total. The team’s life total is adjusted by the amount of life that player gained or lost.
  .rule_text Example: In a Two-Headed Giant game, a player on a team that has 25 life is targeted by an ability that reads, “Target player’s life total becomes 10.” That player’s life total is considered to be 25, so that player loses 15 life. The team winds up at 10 life.
.rule{id: "section-810-9d"}
  .rule_id 810.9d
  .rule_text If an effect would set the life total of each player on a team to a number, that team chooses one of its members. On that team, only that player is affected.
  .rule_text Example: In a Two-Headed Giant game, one team has 7 life and the other team has 13 life. A player casts Repay in Kind, which reads, “Each player’s life total becomes the lowest life total among all players.” Each team chooses one of its members to be affected. The result is that the chosen player on the team that has 13 life loses 6 life, so that team’s life total winds up at 7.
.rule{id: "section-810-9e"}
  .rule_id 810.9e
  .rule_text A player can’t exchange life totals with their teammate. If an effect would cause that to occur, the exchange won’t happen.
.rule{id: "section-810-9f"}
  .rule_id 810.9f
  .rule_text If an effect instructs a player to redistribute any number of players’ life totals, that player may not affect more than one member of each team this way.
.rule{id: "section-810-9g"}
  .rule_id 810.9g
  .rule_text If an effect says that a player can’t gain life, no player on that player’s team can gain life.
.rule{id: "section-810-9h"}
  .rule_id 810.9h
  .rule_text If an effect says that a player can’t lose life, no player on that player’s team can lose life or pay any amount of life other than 0.
.rule{id: "section-810-10"}
  .rule_id 810.10.
  .rule_text Effects that cause players to get poison counters happen to each player individually. The poison counters are shared by the team.
.rule{id: "section-810-10a"}
  .rule_id 810.10a
  .rule_text If an effect needs to know how many poison counters an individual player has, that effect uses the number of poison counters that player’s team has. If an effect needs to know how many poison counters a player’s opponents have, that effect uses the number of poison counters opposing teams have.
.rule{id: "section-810-10b"}
  .rule_id 810.10b
  .rule_text If an effect says that a player loses poison counters, that player’s team loses that many poison counters.
.rule{id: "section-810-10c"}
  .rule_id 810.10c
  .rule_text If an effect says that a player can’t get poison counters, no player on that player’s team can get poison counters.
.rule{id: "section-810-10d"}
  .rule_id 810.10d
  .rule_text If a rule or effect needs to know what kinds of counters an individual player has, that effect uses the kinds of counters that player has and the kinds of counters that player’s team has. A player is “poisoned” if that player’s team has one or more poison counters.
.rule{id: "section-810-11"}
  .rule_id 810.11.
  .rule_text The Two-Headed Giant variant can also be played with equally sized teams of more than two players. For each player a team has beyond the second, that team’s starting life total is increased by 15 and the number of poison counters required for the team to lose is increased by five. (These variants are called Three-Headed Giant, Four-Headed Giant, and so on.)

  .rule_text The deploy creatures option isn’t normally used in the Alternating Teams variant.
.rule{id: "section-811-3"}
  .rule_id 811.3.
  .rule_text At the start of the game, players are seated so that no one is next to a teammate and each team is equally spaced out.
  .rule_text Example: In an Alternating Teams game with three teams, A, B, and C, the seating around the table at the start of the game is A1, B1, C1, A2, B2, C2, A3, B3, C3, and so on.
.rule{id: "section-811-4"}
  .rule_id 811.4.
  .rule_text A player can’t attack opponents who aren’t seated next to them, planeswalkers that aren’t controlled by opponents seated next to them, or battles that aren’t protected by opponents seated next to them.
.rule{id: "section-811-5"}
  .rule_id 811.5.
  .rule_text In the Alternating Teams variant, a team’s resources (cards in hand, mana, and so on) are not shared.

  .rule_text Planechase
.rule{id: "section-901-1"}
  .rule_id 901.1.
  .rule_text In the Planechase variant, plane cards and phenomenon cards add additional abilities and randomness to the game. The Planechase variant uses all the normal rules for a Magic game, with the following additions.
.rule{id: "section-901-2"}
  .rule_id 901.2.
  .rule_text A Planechase game may be a two-player game or a multiplayer game. The default multiplayer setup is the Free-for-All variant with the attack multiple players option and without the limited range of influence option. See rule <a href="#section-806">806</a>, “Free-for-All Variant.”
.rule{id: "section-901-3"}
  .rule_id 901.3.
  .rule_text In addition to the normal game materials, each player needs a supplementary planar deck of at least ten plane and/or phenomenon cards and the game needs one planar die. No more than two cards in a planar deck can be phenomenon cards. Each card in a planar deck must have a different English name. (See rule <a href="#section-311">311</a>, “Planes,” and rule <a href="#section-312">312</a>, “Phenomena.”)
.rule{id: "section-901-3a"}
  .rule_id 901.3a
  .rule_text A planar die is a six-sided die. One face has the Planeswalker symbol. One face has the chaos symbol. The other faces are blank.
.rule{id: "section-901-4-all"}
  .rule_id 901.4.All
  .rule_text plane and phenomenon cards remain in the command zone throughout the game, both while they’re part of a planar deck and while they’re face up.
.rule{id: "section-901-5"}
  .rule_id 901.5.
  .rule_text Once all players have kept their opening hands and used the abilities of cards that allow them to take an action with those cards from their opening hands, the starting player moves the top card of their planar deck off that planar deck and turns it face up. If it’s a phenomenon card, the player puts that card on the bottom of their planar deck and repeats this process until a plane card is turned face up. (See rule <a href="#section-103-7">103.7</a>.) No abilities of any card turned face up this way trigger during this process. The face-up plane card becomes the starting plane.
.rule{id: "section-901-6"}
  .rule_id 901.6.
  .rule_text The owner of a plane or phenomenon card is the player who started the game with it in their planar deck. The controller of a face-up plane or phenomenon card is the player designated as the planar controller. Normally, the planar controller is whoever the active player is. However, if the current planar controller would leave the game, instead the next player in turn order that wouldn’t leave the game becomes the planar controller, then the old planar controller leaves the game. The new planar controller retains that designation until they leave the game or a different player becomes the active player, whichever comes first.
.rule{id: "section-901-7"}
  .rule_id 901.7.
  .rule_text Any abilities of a face-up plane card or phenomenon card in the command zone function from that zone. The card’s static abilities affect the game, its triggered abilities may trigger, and its activated abilities may be activated.
.rule{id: "section-901-7a"}
  .rule_id 901.7a
  .rule_text A face-up plane card or phenomenon card that’s turned face down becomes a new object.
.rule{id: "section-901-8"}
  .rule_id 901.8.
  .rule_text Planechase games have an inherent triggered ability known as the “planeswalking ability.” The full text of this ability is “Whenever you roll the Planeswalker symbol on the planar die, planeswalk.” (See rule <a href="#section-701-24">701.24</a>, “Planeswalk.”) This ability has no source and is controlled by the player whose planar die roll caused it to trigger. This is an exception to rule <a href="#section-113-8">113.8</a>.
.rule{id: "section-901-9"}
  .rule_id 901.9.
  .rule_text Any time the active player has priority and the stack is empty, but only during a main phase of their turn, that player may roll the planar die. Taking this action costs a player an amount of mana equal to the number of times they have previously taken this action on that turn. This is a special action and doesn’t use the stack. Note that this number won’t be equal to the number of times the player has rolled the planar die that turn if an effect has caused the player to roll the planar die that turn. (See rule <a href="#section-116-2i">116.2i</a>.)
.rule{id: "section-901-9a"}
  .rule_id 901.9a
  .rule_text If the die roll is a blank face, nothing happens. The active player gets priority.
.rule{id: "section-901-9b"}
  .rule_id 901.9b
  .rule_text If the die roll is the chaos symbol, chaos ensues (see rule <a href="#section-311-7">311.7</a>). The active player gets priority.
.rule{id: "section-901-9c"}
  .rule_id 901.9c
  .rule_text If the die roll is the Planeswalker symbol, the “planeswalking ability” triggers and is put on the stack. The active player gets priority. (See rule <a href="#section-901-8">901.8</a>.)
.rule{id: "section-901-9d"}
  .rule_id 901.9d
  .rule_text Rolling the planar die will cause any ability that triggers whenever a player rolls one or more dice to trigger. However, any effect that refers to a numerical result of a die roll, including ones that compare the results of that roll to other rolls or to a given number, ignores the rolling of the planar die. See <a href="#section-706">706</a>, “Rolling a Die.”
.rule{id: "section-901-10"}
  .rule_id 901.10.
  .rule_text When a player leaves the game, all objects owned by that player except abilities from phenomena leave the game. (See rule <a href="#section-800-4a">800.4a</a>.) If that includes a face-up plane card or phenomenon card, the planar controller turns the top card of their planar deck face up. This is not a state-based action. It happens as soon as the player leaves the game.
.rule{id: "section-901-10a"}
  .rule_id 901.10a
  .rule_text If a plane leaves the game while a “planeswalking ability” is on the stack, that ability ceases to exist.
.rule{id: "section-901-10b"}
  .rule_id 901.10b
  .rule_text Abilities from phenomena owned by a player who left the game remain on the stack controlled by the new planar controller.
.rule{id: "section-901-11"}
  .rule_id 901.11.
  .rule_text After the game has started, if a player moves the top card of their planar deck off that planar deck and turns it face up, that player has “planeswalked.” Continuous effects with durations that last until a player planeswalks end. Abilities that trigger when a player planeswalks trigger. See rule <a href="#section-701-24">701.24</a>.
.rule{id: "section-901-11a"}
  .rule_id 901.11a
  .rule_text A player may planeswalk as the result of the “planeswalking ability” (see rule <a href="#section-901-8">901.8</a>), because the owner of a face-up plane card or phenomenon card leaves the game (see rule <a href="#section-901-10">901.10</a>), or because a phenomenon’s triggered ability leaves the stack (see rule <a href="#section-704-6f">704.6f</a>). Abilities may also instruct a player to planeswalk.
.rule{id: "section-901-11b"}
  .rule_id 901.11b
  .rule_text The plane card that’s turned face up is the plane the player planeswalks to. The plane card or phenomenon card that’s turned face down, or that leaves the game, is the plane or phenomenon the player planeswalks away from.
.rule{id: "section-901-11c"}
  .rule_id 901.11c
  .rule_text If a player planeswalks when there is more than one face-up plane card, that player planeswalks away from all such planes.

  .rule_id 901.12.
  .rule_text A Two-Headed Giant Planechase game uses all the rules for the Two-Headed Giant multiplayer variant and all the rules for the Planechase casual variant, with the following additions.
.rule{id: "section-901-12a"}
  .rule_id 901.12a
  .rule_text Each player has their own planar deck.
.rule{id: "section-901-12b"}
  .rule_id 901.12b
  .rule_text The planar controller is normally the primary player of the active team. However, if the current planar controller’s team would leave the game, instead the primary player of the next team in turn order that wouldn’t leave the game becomes the planar controller, then the old planar controller’s team leaves the game. The new planar controller retains that designation until they leave the game or a different team becomes the active team, whichever comes first.
.rule{id: "section-901-12c"}
  .rule_id 901.12c
  .rule_text Even though the face-up plane or phenomenon is controlled by just one player, any ability of that plane or phenomenon that refers to “you” applies to both members of the planar controller’s team.
.rule{id: "section-901-12d"}
  .rule_id 901.12d
  .rule_text Since each member of the active team is an active player, each of them may roll the planar die. Each player’s cost to roll the planar die is based on the number of times that particular player has already rolled the planar die that turn.
.rule{id: "section-901-13"}
  .rule_id 901.13.
  .rule_text In multiplayer formats other than Grand Melee, plane cards and phenomenon cards are exempt from the limited range of influence option. Their abilities, and the effects of those abilities, affect all applicable objects and players in the game. (See rule <a href="#section-801">801</a>, “Limited Range of Influence Option.”)
.rule{id: "section-901-14"}
  .rule_id 901.14.
  .rule_text In Grand Melee Planechase games, multiple plane cards or phenomenon cards may be face up at the same time.
.rule{id: "section-901-14a"}
  .rule_id 901.14a
  .rule_text Before the first turn of the game of the game, each player who will start the game with a turn marker sets a starting plane (see rule <a href="#section-901-5">901.5</a>). Each of them is a planar controller.
.rule{id: "section-901-14b"}
  .rule_id 901.14b
  .rule_text If a player would leave the game and that player leaving the game would reduce the number of turn markers in the game, that player first ceases to be a planar controller (but no other player becomes a planar controller), then that player leaves the game. Each face-up plane card or phenomenon card that player controlled is put on the bottom of its owner’s planar deck. No player is considered to have planeswalked.
.rule{id: "section-901-15"}
  .rule_id 901.15.
  .rule_text Single Planar Deck Option
.rule{id: "section-901-15a"}
  .rule_id 901.15a
  .rule_text As an alternative option, a Planechase game may be played with just a single communal planar deck. In that case, the number of cards in the planar deck must be at least forty or at least ten times the number of players in the game, whichever is smaller. The planar deck can’t contain more phenomenon cards than twice the number of players in the game. Each card in the planar deck must have a different English name.
.rule{id: "section-901-15b"}
  .rule_id 901.15b
  .rule_text In a Planechase game using the single planar deck option, the planar controller is considered to be the owner of all cards in the planar deck.
.rule{id: "section-901-15c"}
  .rule_id 901.15c
  .rule_text If any rule or ability refers to a player’s planar deck, the communal planar deck is used.

  .rule_id 902.
  .rule_text Vanguard
.rule{id: "section-902-1"}
  .rule_id 902.1.
  .rule_text In the Vanguard variant, a vanguard card allows each player to play the role of a famous character. Each player will have one face-up vanguard card whose abilities and other characteristics affect the game. The Vanguard variant uses all the normal rules for a Magic game, with the following additions.
.rule{id: "section-902-2"}
  .rule_id 902.2.
  .rule_text A Vanguard game may be a two-player game or a multiplayer game.
.rule{id: "section-902-3"}
  .rule_id 902.3.
  .rule_text In addition to the normal game materials, each player needs a vanguard card. Each vanguard card is placed face up next to its owner’s library before the game begins. All vanguard cards remain in the command zone throughout the game.
.rule{id: "section-902-4"}
  .rule_id 902.4.
  .rule_text Each player’s starting life total is 20 plus or minus the life modifier of their vanguard card.

.rule{id: "section-902-5"}
  .rule_id 902.5.
  .rule_text Each player’s starting hand size is seven cards, as modified by the hand modifier of their vanguard card.
.rule{id: "section-902-5a"}
  .rule_id 902.5a
  .rule_text If a player takes a mulligan in a Vanguard game, just like in a normal game, that player shuffles their hand back into their library, then draws a new hand equal to their starting hand size. (In a multiplayer game, a player’s first mulligan is for the same number of cards as they had before.) See rule <a href="#section-103-5">103.5</a>.
  .rule_text Example: The hand modifier of a player’s vanguard card is +2. That player starts the game with a hand of 9 cards. If the player takes a mulligan three times before keeping, they draw a new hand of nine cards and put three of those on the bottom of their library.
.rule{id: "section-902-5b"}
  .rule_id 902.5b
  .rule_text A player’s maximum hand size is seven, as modified by the hand modifier of their vanguard card.
  .rule_text Example: The hand modifier of a player’s vanguard card is -1. That player’s maximum hand size is six. If that player has more than six cards in their hand as their cleanup step begins, they will discard all but six of them.
.rule{id: "section-902-6"}
  .rule_id 902.6.
  .rule_text The owner of a vanguard card is the player who started the game with it in the command zone. The controller of a face-up vanguard card is its owner.

  .rule_text Commander
.rule{id: "section-903-1"}
  .rule_id 903.1.
  .rule_text In the Commander variant, each deck is led by a legendary creature designated as that deck’s commander. The Commander variant was created and popularized by fans; an independent rules committee maintains additional resources at MTGCommander.net. The Commander variant uses all the normal rules for a Magic game, with the following additions.
.rule{id: "section-903-2"}
  .rule_id 903.2.
  .rule_text A Commander game may be a two-player game or a multiplayer game. The default multiplayer setup is the Free-for-All variant with the attack multiple players option and without the limited range of influence option. See rule <a href="#section-806">806</a>, “Free-for-All Variant.”
.rule{id: "section-903-3"}
  .rule_id 903.3.
  .rule_text Each deck has a legendary creature card designated as its commander. This designation is not a characteristic of the object represented by the card; rather, it is an attribute of the card itself. The card retains this designation even when it changes zones.
  .rule_text Example: A commander that’s been turned face down (due to Ixidron’s effect, for example) is still a commander. A commander that’s copying another card (due to Cytoshape’s effect, for example) is still a commander. A permanent that’s copying a commander (such as a Body Double, for example, copying a commander in a player’s graveyard) is not a commander.
.rule{id: "section-903-3a"}
  .rule_id 903.3a
  .rule_text Some cards have an ability that states the card can be your commander. This ability modifies the rules for deck construction, and it functions before the game begins. See also rule <a href="#section-113-6n">113.6n</a>.
.rule{id: "section-903-3b"}
  .rule_id 903.3b
  .rule_text If a player’s commander is a meld card and it’s melded with the other member of its meld pair, the resulting melded permanent is that player’s commander.
.rule{id: "section-903-3c"}
  .rule_id 903.3c
  .rule_text If a player’s commander is a component of a merged permanent, the resulting merged permanent is that player’s commander.
.rule{id: "section-903-3d"}
  .rule_id 903.3d
  .rule_text If an effect refers to controlling a commander, it refers to a permanent on the battlefield that is a commander. If an effect refers to casting a commander, it refers to a spell that is a commander. If an effect refers to a commander in a specific zone, it refers to a card in that zone that is a commander.
.rule{id: "section-903-3e"}
  .rule_id 903.3e
  .rule_text If an effect refers to a characteristic of “your commander,” it can find the appropriate player’s commander and see its current characteristics, as modified by continuous effects and other rules, in all zones, including that player’s library and hand.
.rule{id: "section-903-4"}
  .rule_id 903.4.
  .rule_text The Commander variant uses color identity to determine what cards can be in a deck with a certain commander. The color identity of a card is the color or colors of any mana symbols in that card’s mana cost or rules text, plus any colors defined by its characteristic-defining abilities (see rule <a href="#section-604-3">604.3</a>) or color indicator (see rule <a href="#section-204">204</a>).
  .rule_text Example: Bosh, Iron Golem is a legendary artifact creature with mana cost <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-8"><span class="sr-only">{8}</span></span></span> and the ability “<span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-3"><span class="sr-only">{3}</span></span><span class="mana mana-cost mana-r"><span class="sr-only">{R}</span></span></span>, Sacrifice an artifact: Bosh, Iron Golem deals damage equal to the sacrificed artifact’s mana value to any target.” Bosh’s color identity is red.
.rule{id: "section-903-4a"}
  .rule_id 903.4a
  .rule_text Color identity is established before the game begins.
.rule{id: "section-903-4b"}
  .rule_id 903.4b
  .rule_text If a commander has a static ability that causes a player to choose its color before the game begins, that choice applies during deck construction and throughout the game, even as the commander changes zones. That choice affects the commander’s color identity. The player reveals that choice as they put their commander into the command zone before the game begins. See rules <a href="#section-103-2c">103.2c</a> and <a href="#section-607-2p">607.2p</a>.
.rule{id: "section-903-4c"}

  .rule_id 903.4d
  .rule_text The back face of a double-faced card (see rule <a href="#section-712">712</a>) is included when determining a card’s color identity. This is an exception to rule <a href="#section-712-8a">712.8a</a>.
  .rule_text Example: Civilized Scholar is the front face of a double-faced card with mana cost <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-2"><span class="sr-only">{2}</span></span><span class="mana mana-cost mana-u"><span class="sr-only">{U}</span></span></span>. Homicidal Brute is the back face of that double-faced card and has a red color indicator. The card’s color identity is blue and red.
.rule{id: "section-903-4e"}
  .rule_id 903.4e
  .rule_text If an ability refers to the colors or number of colors in a commander’s color identity, that quality is undefined if that player doesn’t have a commander. That part of the ability won’t do anything. Costs that refer to that quality are unpayable.
.rule{id: "section-903-5"}
  .rule_id 903.5.
  .rule_text Each Commander deck is subject to the following deck construction rules.
.rule{id: "section-903-5a"}
  .rule_id 903.5a
  .rule_text Each deck must contain exactly <a href="#section-100">100</a> cards, including its commander. In other words, the minimum deck size and the maximum deck size are both <a href="#section-100">100</a>.
.rule{id: "section-903-5b"}
  .rule_id 903.5b
  .rule_text Other than basic lands, each card in a Commander deck must have a different English name. For the purposes of deck construction, cards with interchangeable names have the same English name (see rule <a href="#section-201-3">201.3</a>).
.rule{id: "section-903-5c"}
  .rule_id 903.5c
  .rule_text A card can be included in a Commander deck only if every color in its color identity is also found in the color identity of the deck’s commander.
  .rule_text Example: Wort, the Raidmother is a legendary creature with mana cost <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-4"><span class="sr-only">{4}</span></span><span class="mana mana-cost mana-rg"><span class="sr-only">{R/G}</span></span><span class="mana mana-cost mana-rg"><span class="sr-only">{R/G}</span></span></span>. Wort’s color identity is red and green. Each card in a Wort Commander deck must be only red, only green, both red and green, or have no color. Each mana symbol in the mana cost or rules text of a card in this deck must be only red, only green, both red and green, or have no color.
.rule{id: "section-903-5d"}
  .rule_id 903.5d
  .rule_text A card with a basic land type may be included in a Commander deck only if each color of mana it could produce is included in the commander’s color identity.
  .rule_text Example: Wort, the Raidmother’s color identity is red and green. A Wort Commander deck may include land cards with the basic land types Mountain and/or Forest. It can’t include any land cards with the basic land types Plains, Island, or Swamp.
.rule{id: "section-903-6"}
  .rule_id 903.6.
  .rule_text At the start of the game, each player puts their commander from their deck face up into the command zone. Then each player shuffles the remaining cards of their deck so that the cards are in a random order. Those cards become the player’s library.
.rule{id: "section-903-7"}
  .rule_id 903.7.
  .rule_text Once the starting player has been determined, each player sets their life total to 40 and draws a hand of seven cards.
.rule{id: "section-903-8"}
  .rule_id 903.8.
  .rule_text A player may cast a commander they own from the command zone. A commander cast from the command zone costs an additional <span class="manacost"><span class="mana mana-cost mana-2"><span class="sr-only">{2}</span></span></span> for each previous time the player casting it has cast it from the command zone that game. This additional cost is informally known as the “commander tax.”
.rule{id: "section-903-9"}
  .rule_id 903.9.
  .rule_text A commander may return to the command zone during a Commander game.
.rule{id: "section-903-9a"}
  .rule_id 903.9a
  .rule_text If a commander is in a graveyard or in exile and that object was put into that zone since the last time state-based actions were checked, its owner may put it into the command zone. This is a state-based action. See rule <a href="#section-704">704</a>.
.rule{id: "section-903-9b"}
  .rule_id 903.9b
  .rule_text If a commander would be put into its owner’s hand or library from anywhere, its owner may put it into the command zone instead. This replacement effect may apply more than once to the same event. This is an exception to rule <a href="#section-614-5">614.5</a>.
.rule{id: "section-903-9c"}
  .rule_id 903.9c
  .rule_text If a commander is a melded permanent or a merged permanent and its owner chooses to put it into the command zone using the replacement effect described in rule <a href="#section-903-9b">903.9b</a>, that permanent and each component representing it that isn’t a commander are put into the appropriate zone, and the card that represents it and is a commander is put into the command zone.
.rule{id: "section-903-10"}
  .rule_id 903.10.
  .rule_text The Commander variant includes the following specification for winning and losing the game. All other rules for ending the game also apply. (See rule <a href="#section-104">104</a>.)

.rule{id: "section-903-11"}
  .rule_id 903.11.
  .rule_text If a player is allowed to bring a card from outside the game into a Commander game, that player can’t bring a card into the game this way if it has the same name as a card that player had in their starting deck, if it has the same name as a card that the player owns in the current game, or if any color in its color identity isn’t in the color identity of the player’s commander.

  .rule_id 903.12g
  .rule_text In any Brawl game, the first mulligan a player takes doesn’t count toward the number of cards that player will put on the bottom of their library or the number of mulligans that player may take. Subsequent mulligans are counted toward these numbers as normal.
.rule{id: "section-903-12h"}
  .rule_id 903.12h
  .rule_text Brawl games do not use the state-based action described in rule <a href="#section-704-6c">704.6c</a>, which causes a player to lose the game if they’ve been dealt 21 or more combat damage by a commander.

  .rule_text Commander Draft
.rule{id: "section-903-13a"}
  .rule_id 903.13a
  .rule_text Commander Draft is an option for a different style of Commander game. It consists of a draft (a style of limited play where players choose cards from sealed booster packs to build their decks) followed by a multiplayer game. The Commander Draft option uses Commander Legends booster packs by default.
.rule{id: "section-903-13b"}
  .rule_id 903.13b
  .rule_text A draft typically consists of three draft rounds. In each draft round, each player opens a booster pack, drafts two cards by placing them in a face-down pile in front of them, then passes the remaining cards to the next player. Each player then drafts two cards from the booster pack passed to them and passes the remaining cards. This procedure continues until all cards in that draft round have been drafted.
.rule{id: "section-903-13c"}
  .rule_id 903.13c
  .rule_text In the first and third draft rounds, booster packs are passed to each player’s left. In the second draft round, booster packs are passed to each player’s right.
.rule{id: "section-903-13d"}
  .rule_id 903.13d
  .rule_text During the draft, a player can look only at cards in the booster pack they are currently drafting from and cards they have already drafted. A player may not reveal drafted cards to other players unless an ability instructs them to.
.rule{id: "section-903-13e"}
  .rule_id 903.13e
  .rule_text After the draft is complete, the cards a player drafted become that player’s card pool. If the draft contained draft boosters from Commander Legends, each player may add up to two cards named The Prismatic Piper to their card pool, but only if those cards are used as the player’s commander(s). If the draft contained draft boosters from Commander Legends: Battle for Baldur’s Gate®, each player may add up to two cards named Faceless One to their card pool, but only if those cards are used as the player’s commander(s).
.rule{id: "section-903-13f"}
  .rule_id 903.13f
  .rule_text Commander Draft deck construction follows the same rules as Commander deck construction (see rule <a href="#section-903-5">903.5</a>) with two exceptions: (1) A player’s deck must contain at least 60 cards. There is no maximum deck size. (2) A player’s deck may include any number of cards from that player’s card pool with the same name.

.rule{id: "section-904-2"}
  .rule_id 904.2.
  .rule_text The default setup for an Archenemy game is the Team vs. Team multiplayer variant (see rule <a href="#section-808">808</a>) involving exactly two teams. The attack multiple players option (see rule <a href="#section-802">802</a>) and the shared team turns option (see rule <a href="#section-805">805</a>) are used; no other multiplayer options are used.
.rule{id: "section-904-2a"}

.rule{id: "section-904-7"}
  .rule_id 904.7.
  .rule_text The owner of a scheme card is the player who started the game with it in the command zone. The controller of a face-up scheme card is its owner.
.rule{id: "section-904-8"}
  .rule_id 904.8.

.rule{id: "section-904-9"}
  .rule_id 904.9.
  .rule_text Immediately after the archenemy’s precombat main phase begins during each of their turns, that player moves the top card of their scheme deck off that scheme deck and turns it face up. This is called “setting that scheme in motion.” (See rule <a href="#section-701-25">701.25</a>.) This turn-based action doesn’t use the stack. Abilities of that scheme card that trigger “When you set this scheme in motion” trigger.
.rule{id: "section-904-10"}
  .rule_id 904.10.
  .rule_text If a non-ongoing scheme card is face up in the command zone, and no triggered abilities of any scheme are on the stack or waiting to be put on the stack, that scheme card is turned face down and put on the bottom of its owner’s scheme deck the next time a player would receive priority. (This is a state-based action. See rule <a href="#section-704">704</a>.)
.rule{id: "section-904-11"}
  .rule_id 904.11.

.rule{id: "section-905-1a"}
  .rule_id 905.1a
  .rule_text A draft typically consists of three draft rounds. In each draft round, each player opens a booster pack, drafts one card by placing that card in a face-down pile in front of the player, then passes the remaining cards to the next player. Each player then drafts a card from the booster pack passed to them and passes the remaining cards. This procedure continues until all cards in that draft round have been drafted.

.rule{id: "section-905-2b"}
  .rule_id 905.2b
  .rule_text Some cards instruct players to reveal them as they’re drafted and then note some information, such as a number or color. This information can be referred to by other abilities during the game. Any player can look at this information at any time during the draft or game. After the information is noted, the drafted card is turned face down and added to the player’s drafted cards pile.
.rule{id: "section-905-2c"}
  .rule_id 905.2c
  .rule_text Some cards instruct players to draft them face up. Each such card remains face up until the draft is complete, an effect instructs the person who drafted it to turn it face down, or the card leaves that player’s drafted cards pile. While the card is face up, all players may look at it.
.rule{id: "section-905-3"}
