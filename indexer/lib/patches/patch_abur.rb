  # Most sheets are frow http://www.lethe.xyz/mtg/collation/lea.html
  #
  # The uncommon and rare sheets for Alpha are not known exactly,
  # but the evidence from pack openings is consistent with the popular theory
  # that they are basically the same as the Beta sheets. The most notable difference
  # is the absence of Circle of Protection: Black and Volcanic Island that were added for Beta.
  # Beta also added a third art variation for each basic land, but it appears that positions
  # were not changed â€” only some of the existing lands were changed to the new art.
  # There is, however, an exception to this on the common sheet where analysis of pack
  # openings has revealed that the land to the left of Circle of Protection: Black is also different.
  #
  # I assume both variants of each Alpha land are equally common
  # Except rare sheet has 5 Islands, so I arbitrarily assume first is twice as likely
